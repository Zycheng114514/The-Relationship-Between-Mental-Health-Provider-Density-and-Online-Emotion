ihxbl5e,"&gt; You say that like conservatives have some kind of successful plan to eliminate behavior like this

They do, it's called 'not putting up with the bullshit'. 

&gt; if you actually look at statistics, the rates of opiate abuse in conservative states and areas is significantly worse. Red states and cities have a significantly higher rate of opiate and alcohol abuse, suicide, and poor education.

Many of those states are the poorest in the country, yet they still don't have shanty towns of tents and someone shooting up every block or two in plain site of children. Outside of democratic-run cities, it's really not tolerated. They also don't bend over backwards throwing countless millions into a sinkhole supporting their toxic lifestyle or promoting their addictions.

fihj17y,"I meant to spur a discussion, but did a poor job.  I know the gun culture I was raised in was irresponsible and people have been injured and killed because of it.  The same culture caused a lot of vehicle deaths too. The statistics prove what I witnessed.  Gun culture states have loaded and unsecured weapons in millions of households with children.  They have much higher accidental injury rates, and much higher completed suicide rates.

I also have witnessed first hand an irresponsible marketing and consumer culture surrounding the promotion of killing people.

Lately, I see people addicted to outrage about trying to solve these things just like anti vaxxers, anti fluoride in their water, anti seatbelt, and anti round earth folks are.

If people think guns are responsibilities and not rights, then they have their weapons stolen less, don’t sell them at garage sales, and are careful about selling them to knuckleheads.  

I remember gun journalists getting fired for noting 2A defenders marching into Starbucks by the dozens fully armed was weird and crazy.  Because it was.

The difference between a criminal conviction and a civil adjudication is important. There shouldn't be any problem addressing Zimmerman's history of adjudicated child abuse issues, which he tacitly conceded by signing on to the final custody order. He just doesn't have any convictions. It probably sounds unnecessarily pedantic to many non-lawyers, but we are this way for a reason.

ebaiqnq,"&gt; Gender dysphoria causes all kinds of legitimate medical issues, most prominently depression, suicidal ideation, and intense anxiety.

It is actually not fully understood whether gender dysphoria causes those issues or vice versa. It's a sort of chicken and egg situation. It also may vary on an individual basis. And chopping off genitals is a pretty dangerous and radical medical procedure. Even take for example the stomach staple surgery, most people are on board acknowledging that it's best to exercise all diet and exercise options before conducting the surgery that has a relatively high chance of serious complications and death. And then take the example of elective suicide for people with depression. In the countries that have elective suicide, in order to qualify you have to prove that you aren't clinically depressed.

People blinded by political tribalism will take this however they want but this is definitely a case where politics is threatening to overrule science and medicine. Which throughout history has overwhelmingly been a threat from the political right but in this case is a threat from the political left. The American Psychiatric Association in all their latest documentation still considers gender dysphoria to be a mental disorder. So when you're talking about allowing mentally ill people to choose to have their genitals chopped off, and in some of these cases being discussed in the media even situations where organizations are trying to help minors have their genitals chopped off against the will of their parents, I think that the risk of this political interference to peoples' long term health and welfare is very profound.

I finally gave up, decided things would never get better, and ended up calling my mom and asking her to take me to the hospital because I felt suicidal. They suggested I might need mood-stabilizers and anti-psychotics instead of plain old SSRI's. I got in with a psych nurse and she put me on Lithium, Vraylar, and Wellbutrin and I finally felt okay for the first time. I realized these meds were really working when I could actually fathom going grocery shopping, which might sound weird but if you're depressed, probably doesn't.

It has been really hard on my mental health, but I feel like I can manage it whereas before I would've curled up into a ball and slept for weeks. 

While I have never had a full-on manic episode, meds that are used to treat bipolar disorder are what work for me and ultimately ended up saving my life. If SSRI's aren't cutting it, it's worth suggesting trying something else with your doctor. You can feel human, I promise.

I'm not talking Runyon or Griffith Park, which are zoos these days, but I've been able to spend most of my weekends driving out with my dog and doing safe, social distanced outdoor activities in the various state parks and national forests that are like an hour's drive away.  

Everyone talks about how LA is depressing right now because restaurants, bars, museums, etc are closed, and that's certainly correct, but I'm feeling somewhat cautiously optimistic about my mental health over the next few months because of the weather and access to nature in this area.

I was super brief with my point because Reddit arguments are scary and people can be endless dicks on the internet for no reason so I feel like you misunderstand what I was trying to convey, but you seem like a cool dude so here goes. 

So I’m from a pretty privileged middle/upper-class neighborhood. I grew up with snacks in the cabinet, 3 meals a day and loving parents. I still was a dick sometimes. I skipped school every day and I broke some hearts. Nothing really mattered to me then because I was a kid, establishing myself didn’t really matter and everything was taken care of. 

My dad came from a shitty dad, my mom came from a shitty mom. They both did their best and produced three pretty okay kids while working full time. As I’m sure you know, nobody really knows all the answers when it comes to parenting. You just kinda do your best at the end of the day like anybody else. 

But what happens when centuries of less than adequate habits are passed down over the years? The parents are still doing their best. They’re doing what they know. But the parents can be in shitty situations themselves, and I don’t know any kid, myself included, that just sat there and did exactly what they were told. Eventually following your logic, we get into kids and parents in a bad neighborhood presumably by this article. Still not even thinking about race/class, how are you going to monitor the kids while they’re at school? Sports practice? Extra curricular activities? Demand complete transparency? Oh boy, we just cooked up a recipe for a kid to develop a severe issue with telling lies. 

I’m not saying the parents aren’t at fault at all. There’s always *something* that could’ve been done. You can say that about your friend from highschool who you knew was depressed and killed themselves. You can say that about the guy you thought maybe had a little bit too much to drink and shouldn’t have driven home, and got in an accident and caused injuries to themselves or others. But at the end of the day in each and all of these situations there’s more to it than just the parents. 

A lot of these people are just doing their best. The kid in the bad neighborhood, the meth addict in the rich neighborhood, the kid trying to find a meal a day in the south, etc. I’ve wandered a bit but I hope I explained my opinion well enough.",comment,Chicago,0.0

I think that is so important for young people, besides trying to figure out a good career path, they need to form relationships and get a good group of people they can trust.  While I respect people that can go it somewhat alone and thrive, most people need that family/community or whatever you want to call it.  Very few personality types thrive in solitude yet our culture seems to be moving more towards isolation.  

I feel the same way about when people have kids.  Money can take care of a lot with kids but family/friends/community is just as important or even more so.  Having friends and family step in to give you a break from your kids is extremely helpful.  A lot of the financial burden of children is taken away by having a great group of people to rally around you.

After WWII we had unions, we had 70% corporate tax, but we still had elites. No rich people were harmed. But now we're all crabs at the bottom of the barrel clawing each other.

jq664q5,"I don’t know your situation but without context this sounds like it will be very difficult for you. What is your monthly budget? What part of LA are you looking at? Do you have family or a support system here to fall back on in case things go poorly? Is there someone willing to co-sign a lease for you? How much do you have in savings? (I would recommend at least $5k to move here with and even that will only last you a month or two if you’re not working). 

You will have a hard time finding any landlord who is willing to rent to a bunch of 18 year olds with no credit or rental history. You may be able to find a room for rent on Craigslist or something but even then it will likely be expensive and not a desirable living situation. What it comes down to then is you asking yourself if you are willing to bust your ass working (possibly multiple jobs) just to be able to afford to come home to a place that you don’t even like. LA is cool when you have money, but it can be very difficult/depressing to live here if you do not have a decent income/savings/financial stability. 

To provide some context, I am in my early 30s and I live in one of the “nicest” (most expensive) areas of LA. I moved here when I was 20 and hoped all over California working a ton and living with a million roomates. In the end I made it work, however I think that the current state of the rental market here would make it a very different situation if I moved here in 2023.

hlf8sfn,"“…they simply don’t care anymore…”

Yes, and? What do you expect to happen, when you have people who have no hope left of ever escaping their current situation, who are dealing with untreated mental and physical health issues and trauma and then being punished for essentially self-medicating (because our health care system makes it prohibitively expensive to get ANY help), who get treated as subhuman trash by EVERYONE, who keep having what little they’ve managed to get trashed by the cops, etc.

Speaking from experience, chronic poverty absolutely crushes you on every level. It becomes a vicious cycle of grief, and every small failure to escape it makes the next cycle worse. What’s the point in keeping things neat and tidy? It’s not going to make much difference at that level; you’ll still be just as poor and cold and tired and depressed, no matter how neat and tidy you keep your space. 

The cops and the people passing you by on the street are still going to kick you around and spit on you and call you names, no matter how clean you try to keep your area.

Random strangers are still going to trash your tent just because you’re an easy target and no one is going to come to help defend you, and then you’ll get blamed for “leaving a mess” even though it was neat and tidy before some asshole took a baseball bat to it while cursing at you for “being a worthless bum.”

And HOW do you keep it clean? Everything costs money! Access to clean water costs money. Soap costs money. Trash bags cost money. Plastic containers to keep your stuff dry and contained COSTS MONEY.

If they do bag up their trash, what then? Where do they take it? Housed people take for granted that we have routine trash pickup that someone else handles; all we have to do is take it to our assigned dumpster and that’s the end of it. Homeless people don’t have assigned dumpsters with weekly trash pickup. Even if they have access to a trash can at the park, those things fill up crazy fast, because homeless people don’t have the luxury of cleaning stuff out and reusing it. There’s not a separate bin for recycling, either. And they don’t get picked up as often.

The chronic squalor is wrong, sure, but there’s a REASON for it. It’s not as simple as “these people are bad, unlike the GOOD homeless people.”

These are people who have lost all hope, and therefore all motivation to even try, and every time people bring out the torches and pitchforks and destroy their encampments, that just gives them more reason to stop trying.",comment,Seattle,1.0

They were all sad that they had to start over with someone new in my position, and so am I, honestly. It was the first job I've had in over 5 years where I felt like we could crack jokes like peers or almost friends. Pre COVID I was only here for 4 months and a lot of the people I met were beginning to form promising new work friend groups. I know a lot of people don't make true friends at work, but one of my childhood friends met her two best friends at work and now they do everything together even after they left their previous job. New job is in a different area but promises not to be that hard at first based on other people that work there. But I think I've just been stressed out for so long that I'm not even happy about the new job. Also not enthused about learning a new area when I'm finally comfortable in an existing area and could just be kicking back on the weekends dating or having fun.

Family is moving out of our temporary housing that we've been in for the last 6 months while insurance renovates our home after a burst pipe that happened in July. So we're moving out right around the time I'd like to swing a trip before my new job. Not sure If I can pre move my stuff, fly away, then fly back in time for my new job, or if I'll have to give up the last minute trip hopes.

Dating is the thing that sucks the utmost donkey balls. I reactivated my dating apps 3 weeks ago and it's like every time I log back on, the experience is exponentially worse.

https://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/2t3zmn/good_wisdom_on_being_short/

&gt; Late '20s here. I used to be an awkward dork. It's gotten significantly better after UG
The brutal honest truth is that short men - particularly minorities - are UGLY to many American women. U-G-L-Y. You shouldn't take advice from other men because they simply aren't in the same position you are. ""Just be confident bro"" and taking a trip to Vancouver isn't a good approach because it doesn't solve some underlying fundamental issues you probably have. If anything, I'm guessing you'll strike out and go home even more depressed. This is going to require an entire change in mindset and personality because that's how badly the world can fuck over short minority dudes in today's world.

The truth is you will never be a player. Not in a 2014 anglo nation at least. At 33, you probably figured this out. When you look at a picture of a BBW, do you get a rock hard boner? No you probably don't, and that's analogous to what most modern western women feel when they look at a guy shorter than them. Maybe not repulsion, but definitely little to no sexual attraction.

Yet knowing and understanding this I still get action from time to time.

A few topics to consider
1) Being short is arbitrary
2) Why do you need validation?
3) Why height is an issue
4) Where to look for women

1) As I'm writing this there's probably some Kurd who is getting assfucked by an ISIS terrorist. There's another person dying of malnutrition in Africa. There's another person who has been laid off and can't provide for family after working for a company for 15 years after a retard VP was trying to cover up his own mistakes. There's another person who is getting divorced several years after initially attracting her with his looks and charm but is now having his kids taken away, and he's experiencing pain and emotional turmoil brutal heartbreak. 110 billion humans have ever lived on this planet and most of their lives sucked.

At the same time, you were born with brains and have a strong work ethic instilled into you at an earlier age. If you were living in a different time or different country, yes it's very likely you wouldn't be foreveralone
All of the above are examples where arbitrary elements of the universe come into play - raw intelligence, profession, short height, being invaded by a foreign army, malnourished, abused as a child, etc. It makes absolutely no sense why some are given everything and most others nothing. So let me ask you this - how can you respect a world where this occurs? You shouldn't. IT IS STUPID and not worthy of your respect. Being short and women not liking short asian men is no different from this standpoint. Just another very stupid and arbitrary element of this world.

2) Building on point #1, there are a LOT of shitty women out there. Growing up and hanging around men, did you feel as if many were douchebags? Same is true for women. A lot of them suck, have low IQs, and generally make bad decisions. This is where your inexperience hurts you because many can be ruthless, selfish, irrational, or just plain crazy at times and you may have never seen that side of them since they'll often keep it together out in public. Ask yourself this: If they're going to pass up a Dentist making 200k and is otherwise stable, how fucking stupid are they? Why do you even care what they think? Let them go back to their bad decisions and future divorces. They are STUPID and not worthy of your respect.

I once read that over half of strippers have borderline personality disorder. I imagine that for prostitutes, the % is even higher. It's very likely some legitimately liked you and found you attractive due to their own mental illness and their warped sex drive....but it will fade away after a few hours since all of their emotions are very temporary. There's your validation right there, even if its tainted

3) Height is a proxy for dominance, and this is why short beefy cholo thugs can still do well with women. What's your personality like? Taller, good looking males can get away with being introverted awkward dorks but a smaller male? It's a death sentence. Our biology cannot keep up with society so even though it doesn't make sense in today's world, attraction is still driven by ape biology. If you're not assertive nor confident, work on this. Take tips on how to look people in the eye, speak clearly, give firm handshakes, etc. but a more fundamental and long lasting approach to go about in doing this learning how to respect and love yourself. Learn to accept who you are.

4) If I were you, I would not give up escorts. If you're a dentist you prob have money, so I'm assuming you're banging attractive ones and not some backpage meth addict. Don't bother aggressively looking for one night stands or FWBs - in your situation the reward might not be worth the effort. The funny thing is it's very likely you've have had sex with hotter women than even most Chads

Black, fobby asian, and fobby indian women are the most receptive to me. Don't bother with white women in America - ironically, I've had more experience with them than any other race, but that's largely due to an overexposure to them compared to other race. The hit rate is just way, way lower.

I would recommend focusing on fobby asian women who still have traditional values. I would not suggest limiting yourself to upper middle class women since a large portion are trashy hypergamous shrews with mental issues nowadays. Focus on loyalty, compatible personalities, has good relations with family, and the ability to resolve conflicts more than any other quality including looks. You may not get a dimepiece, so bang all of the hot escorts you can and get that out of your system before settling down. Most women do not look very good at 40 anyway, so NBD if you can't find someone very attractive. Beauty is temporary.

At the end of the day, accept reality for what it is (retarded and arbitrary) and just enjoy the ride. It really comes down to self respect, living life on your terms, and understanding that some of the more idiotic and lucky parts of our lives is just randomness
That's what gotten me laid. Telling the world (and women) to take it or leave it. I love me and I know who I am. That's all I need.

g3gf6rn,"I was just in Ithaca at the start of August, as well as Watkins Glen. I also passed through Corning and did a loop around Seneca Lake. 

In Ithaca, There are several brand name hotels right downtown, which was surprisingly dense and walkable. However, Ithaca was empty - there were almost zero students around, which made for oddly vacant streets. Whether Cornell and Ithaca College return to classes will have a major impact on your experience. If they’re back then streets will be lively. If not, then depressing ghost town because the people who make it lively are missing. 

Ithaca reminded me a lot of Ann Arbor - cool college place that is too fond and forgiving of bums and derelicts - it seems to be where the druggies roll down to when they cannot hang on where they are. There were several in the pedestrian mall area, which makes sense - I’m sure thats where to find the handouts under normal circumstances. 

Mask compliance in Upstate is lacking compared to in NYC, so be prepared for dodging morons. 

Ithaca was the largest settlement that I saw, bigger than Watkins Glen or Corning (decent little downtown, did not expect that). Elmira seems to have some size but we didn’t go there. WG is just a small town on a wide street. Not much there except the obligatory restaurants, gas station, wine store. But in WG you’ll be immediately in blue skies whereas Ithaca is a surprisingly dense city when you’re in it. 

Ithaca would be a fine launching pad for hiking, though you’d be shlepping your gear in and out of a hotel that might not be built for it. Downtown is surprisingly dense - you probably will have to park in a ramp or lot a block away from your hotel.  Restaurants were open for outside dining and takeout. There was also a dense stretch of takeout joints up in college town near Cornell, but it seemed super quiet at the time. 

The Harbor Hotel in Watkins Glen should quiet down once Labor Day passes. Big rooms, much (!) better bed than I had in Ithaca at the Hilton Garden Inn. Convenient parking. 

My guess is that the Ithaca hotels get heavily used and abused by visiting college teams, conferences, etc. By contrast, that Harbor Hotel that I keep mentioning in WG is probably used by vineyard tourists - more middle aged folks looking for quiet. Nice place, but damn the walls and ceiling were thin. 

There is an excellent outdoors store in Ithaca right on the pedestrian mall area, in case you forget anything. Also plenty of groceries, etc. with a drive. They have ... Wegmans!

By contrast, not much of anything for shopping once you leave Watkins Glen. You can find what you need but it’s a much more small town vibe. I think Corning is the local commercial center, half an hour away, over a big hill. Your best place for gear would likely be the outdoors section at a Walmart, wherever that is. 

In addition to the Finger Lakes trail, there are many state parks in the area, plus state forests and a national forest, both near Ithaca and near Watkins Glen. Maybe particularly near Ithaca?

In either place, be ready for driving seriously steep hills. Out of nowhere you can be nose-up or nose-down something that you truly did not expect. And just outside of either Ithaca or Watkins Glen there’s not much of anything. So make sure your car is in good shape. Those hills are nowhere to trust a clunker. Clean your windows and have fresh wipers - be ready for it. Know how to use low gear on the transmission before you get there.",comment,NYC,1.0

Their lives were often cut shorter but the type of life they lived reuired lots of movement so they were very strong. Their minds were active since they had to know so much about the environment. Plants, seasons, physical threats ability to build and take down shelters etc etc...There was a time in history when these minds kept humanity going. Survival of micro communities depended on these skills.
Man was no predictable prey.. humans were hunters.Inteligent unpredictable to other species.

The agricultural revolution resulted in more security but less freedom. The government made all forms of hunter lifestyle unsustainable. The freedom in reference to the lifestyle above is not achievable working an 8-5. Primarily because the hunter and gatherer is an active thinker. The people working the fields have themselves become like vegetables. Think about it.. what kind of hunter.. a real one with all the skills would work in 90% of these retail stores? Many become entrpeneurs, criminals, homeless, vagabonds is my guess.

I watched a science video about these unique individuals and they are symetrical to the ""healthy"" homeless you describe.

However. Being homeless is hard, stress constant problems and etc can make even the strongest person stressed, depressed etc. Especially if they believe what culuture today says about them. They are abused exposed to drugs and pretty much swept under the rug with other problems of our societies. UNHEALTHY brain tissue can be the result of homelessness not always the cause.

“The MARTA Board of Directors grieves the shocking death of our GM/CEO Jeff Parker who has died by suicide. He was an outstanding leader and steward of MARTA whose passing leaves us all heartbroken. As Chairwoman and on behalf of my fellow MARTA board members, we are devastated at this loss as we valued Jeff’s leadership and looked forward to him bringing his vision for transit to fruition. The entire metro Atlanta region owes him a debt of gratitude for his transformational efforts and we will not stop working to build on the foundation he created. As we struggle to understand the complexity of this tragedy, we grieve with and for his wife Erin, his daughters and all of Jeff’s family and friends as well as his MARTA family. As we continue to grieve, we want you to know that suicide is preventable and help is available to you.”",comment,Atlanta,1.0

The courts will have to sort this one out, but pensioners may be without a pension check for several months while all of this is being sorted out.

It's a real shame that there can't be a ""come to Jesus"" meeting with everyone where they are shown the math and offered a deal where everyone gets a certain percentage cut of pension in order to save the entire system.

g2if3eh,"Been online gaming with some family and friends, and it's a lot better than straight video calls.  You are chatting for hours, but collaboratively working on something together instead of trying to come up with conversation.  Its hard having continuous, fulfilling 1 on 1 conversations right now since life is depressing and people are mostly stuck at home.  You only hear them over a mic, so can be in your pj's and not worry about your appearance.  

For me, it's really increased the feeling of staying connected, and the hours fly by when you get into it.  Even if you aren't a typical ""gamer"", there are some good ones out almost anyone can get into if you give them a chance.  Some of my favorites for these family sessions are *Sea of Thieves* (Pirate adventure) and *Fallout 76* (Apocalyptic wasteland adventure heavy on building/resource management).  Gaming is much less intimidating when you are in a group of people you personally know, and its an activity that keeps your brain working.  If you know people that already game, they would probably be thrilled to show you the ropes and be your ""Sherpa""!  I've also ""met"" some really cool people through these games, and I'd be happy to add you as a friend and play together if this sounds interesting to you. Plus, it's really the best bang for your buck in hours spent per dollar of any entertainment type.

Another idea for you that I'm doing with a couple close, responsible friends.. because the isolation is rough and I need to get out of the house I've barely left since March. We are going camping soon on a friend's private land, each with our own tent or RV so we can socially distance and have fun outdoors (with masks) and to get a break from the increased digital consumption.  We are all getting tests prior and sharing our results to lower the risks.

I am really lucky that my husband and I have each other through this, but even with a companion I am feeling lonely and isolated too being mostly cut off from other people.

If you're negative right now it's free upvotes (posts like ""fuck the celtics"" and shit like that), and if you're positive you get downvoted. In both instances no one seems to care if your points make sense or not, so we have emboldened the cynics who talk out their ass while demotivating anyone with the unpopular opinion that the C's can get out of this. Honestly I'm not nearly as depressed about the games as I am about the fan reaction at a time like this.

In the end, no matter what outcome we get in this series one side is going to say ""SEE?! I told you!"" even though they never did any research or critical thought in the first place.

To be clear: The cynics who actually use facts are fine, as are the optimists who do the same. Even if they use confirmation bias. I don't like any of these people that just make up whatever they want to suit their stance.

Not everyone here (myself included) is a ""spoiled"" Boston sports fan outside of the Celtics.

dphxajt,"&gt; It's sad, but if someone wants to jump in front of a train, they're going to jump in front of a train.

Probably incorrect. 

A common misconception is that when someone is suicidal, nothing is going to stop them. However, immediate accessibility plays a huge factor in suicide rates. 

In the UK, a popular suicide method was ""sticking your head in an oven"". The gas used would quickly cause you to pass out and asphyxiate. 

Then, they changed the gas. This new gas had drastically lower CO content and wasn't as good of a suicide method. Not only did the suicide rate by gas plummet, but so did the suicide rate in general.

The person selling them told me they put mushrooms in them to make the high last longer.  I didn't think much of it at the time.  After about 2 months of eating edibles, I noticed a change in my mood. I wasn't suicidal anymore. Started feeling cheerful. My sister asked if my meds had changed, and I said no, it must be the edibles! Unfortunately, shortly after, they lost their mushroom connection, and they're shut down now anyhow.

The City decided to plant over 40,000 palms in honor of the 1932 Olympics and to avert the unemployment following the Great Depression. Interestingly enough, only the super tall, skinny Washington Filifera species are native to Southern California. They were used by Native Americans for food and weaving. They grow naturally in spring-fed desert oases (read: Palm Springs, CA)
The average age of these palms is around 85 years old. Some simple math says the thousands of palms planted in the '30s are nearing the end of their lives. LA City announced that they will be replacing the trees with more drought tolerant Sycamore (itchy, spiky seed pods we used to throw at eachother as kids) and Oaks ( acorns and spiky leaves).

The point is that it does have a negative effect, and the way that trans people are treated, othered, marginalized definitely has an impact on their high rate of depression and suicide. It is not being manipulative to point that out.

And... even if it didn't... it's still just a generally shitty thing to do that takes little effort to get better about. If you wanna talk about trans women, call them trans women.

In fact, technically Americans have MORE to complain about when it comes to police brutality given people are getting killed in broad daylight by cops.

frti2qc,"Even though reporting levels are depressed by being on a holiday weekend, we still got +8k tests. This hopefully still means our hopeful trends are still going well.  

 &amp;nbsp;

With this new data, I want to mention something that is far too late to raise in the most recent COVID-related threads. For some reason, there has been some serious support in the tone of the impossibility of continued social distancing and having an economy. We don't have to debate on pure theory and speculation - advocating and getting significant upvotes for abandoning social distancing practices for untested quarantine strategies, decrying all the restaurants are gonna die, and etc.  We do have other countries we can look for examples.

&amp;nbsp;

I believe today's data again supports this hope - in particular South Korea. SK is not back to ""the way it was before"", but businesses are open and people are living lives beyond staying home. They have even suffered a setback - a renewed ""outbreak"" of leading to several days of +20/+30 daily cases because their reopening of nightclubs did not work out very well. But fortunately, it is quickly under control because of the robust testing and tracing system.  

&amp;nbsp;


We don't have the same ""numbers"" of South Korea, but we are still following the same ""shape"". Our testing numbers have continued to improve (though not truly representative as it's not random, to be fair), we are getting increasing anecdotes of excess tests because of lack of people (though there are also still too many anecdotes of people saying they can't get tested), and now have a +1,600 contact tracing workforce that has been running for several weeks now (though I have seen many upvoted comments doubting it's value). Even at today's case number, we are still a long way to S. Korea's numbers, but for Massachusetts, it's starting to get close enough to imagine without being wildly idealistic. I think we are close enough to the point that we can start to look at policies and strategies beyond pure lockdown. I don't mean government policies as probably none reading this are government officials, but I mean our personal policies and practices. 

 &amp;nbsp;

If our pattern continues to hold, our conditions will eventually reach that point (even if the rest of the country don't).

dqk8o90,"**Cincinnati Subway**

The Cincinnati Subway is a set of incomplete, derelict tunnels and stations for a rapid transit system beneath the streets of Cincinnati, Ohio. It is recognized as the largest abandoned subway tunnel system in the United States. It was built in the early twentieth century as an upgrade to the Cincinnati streetcar system, but was abandoned due to escalating costs, the collapse of funding amidst political bickering, and the Great Depression during the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1928, the construction of the subway system in Cincinnati was indefinitely canceled.

That's not gender dysphoria, that's being transgender. Gender dysphoria is knowing you are one thing but having to live with a body that is another. Dysphoria means a state of unease or dissatisfaction, it's inherently not a good thing.

rw8701,"EMS workers need your help &amp;#x200B;

TL;DR  One of your city’s essential, taxpayer funded emergency services is a dumpster fire, there’s a rare opportunity to make it better, and we need the public to hold their government accountable.  Link to email city council members at end.  

The state of your local Emergency Medical Service is in crisis and needs your help.

You deserve good government. You deserve well managed city services.  As citizens and taxpayers of this city and county, you deserve well managed emergency services.  You never want to use EMS, but when you do, you hope that the people responding are adequately trained, not brand new to the job, aren’t burned out, so tired they may fall asleep at the wheel, etc.

Austin Travis County EMS is currently in a state of FUBAR. Upper management is trying to spin the situation as a result of COVID, nationwide workforce and supply chain issues, the traumatic nature of the job, etc., but the truth is that the situation we find ourselves in is the result of decades of mismanagement.

Morale is lower than at any time we've seen it in decades of working here. People who are eligible are retiring years before they planned to. Others are quitting in droves.  We are entering a vicious cycle, in which management is attempting to fix a complex situation beyond their capabilities with the only tools they’ve ever known: asking more of an already overworked workforce. The only reason the wheels have kept turning so far is because the field employees are professional problem solvers by the nature of their jobs, but as morale drops lower and lower, our will and capacity to fix problems created by management is dropping as well.

For decades, we had a well meaning, but very docile, weak-willed chief who allowed a small junta of men to create a tight, self protecting Good Ol' Boy culture at the top. Employees in the field are beaten down by a stressful job in which, instead of receiving support from the top, they receive additional problems and stress.  Our employee association exists to advocate for us, yet spends most of its time solving mundane issues that management has neglected.

The culture is particularly toxic to those who don't ""go along"" with the ""yes men"" culture and those who point out issues and strive to make improvements. These people are blackballed from promotion, pushed into ""sub-basement desk jobs"" where they can't be heard, and generally excluded from decision making processes in a variety of other ways.

Extreme discrepancies exist between offenses that have resulted in firing vs. those that are given a wrist slap. Perpetrators of domestic abuse,  DWI charges (twice for one high ranking individual), sexual abuse of subordinate employees, all still work here, and have even been promoted. Meanwhile others have been fired for unapproved social media postings, testing positive for off duty THC use, engaging in technical minor violations of secondary employment , and questioning authority.

The reason this is important to know right now, is that we have a rare opportunity to change this culture. The old chief quietly resigned this year, and the city manager is in the process of selecting a new chief. Given how long the last chief held the position, we may not have another chance to effect change for decades.

Worryingly, the leader of this small junta that has actually been running the department these past decades, Jasper Brown, is applying for the chief position.

The job post originally required that the applicant be a paramedic. Brown, who was only briefly an EMT (which is roughly a 6 month education vs. the roughly 2 year education of a paramedic) before rapidly promoting to management, has attempted and failed the state paramedic exam multiple times. However, the pre-qualification of being a paramedic (which is determined by an HR department that Brown has sway over, was mysteriously dropped recently.

Brown has been sending out department emails ""from the chief"", and making statements that, ""if you don't like the changes I'm making now, you won't like it when I'm chief.""

We have many extremely qualified and diverse candidates for this chief position, candidates with:

* Proven track records of successfully leading larger and more complex organizations
* High levels of education in management, emergency operations, disaster management, etc.
* Extensive experience as EMS field providers who understand the situation from being boots on the ground.
* Extensive medical training and experience, including at least one physician.
* Non white male candidates.

Brown is none of these things.

History is full of examples of seemingly unqualified people who got a battlefield promotion and rose to the occasion. In this regard, Brown is *uniquely unqualified, because he alone among the candidates has held a position largely responsible for creating the disaster we currently find ourselves in.*

Here are some highlights of Brown's legacy of failures as a leader:

* He has been present in a leadership role for every single EMS scandal in the last two decades.  Porngate, COPEgate, nothing-but-white-males-gate, morale gate, COVID response gate, winter storm response gate, etc.
* Ignores advice of experts, promoting those who he personally knows and gets along with vs. those with actual subject matter expertise for important public safety positions such as disaster response management.
* ATCEMS  field employees have a lower job satisfaction than Texas prison guards.
* He was in a direct leadership position with the offensively named ""zero to hero"" program designed to bring more minorities into EMS.  It was a complete failure that did not result with a single retained field provider, yet cost taxpayers roughly 1.2 million.
* He has done nothing to directly address medic suicides.  He has quoted the ""Code Green Campaign"" as his success, but had nothing to do with it, and the leader of that program resigned in disgust from the lack of support or leadership from the top.
* He has done nothing to address the abnormally high attrition rate, other than cut training standards to rush new hires through a system into a job that is dangerous to them and patients.
* He has done nothing to address the county's dissatisfaction with ATCEMS.  Multiple ESDs have become so dissatisfied that they have started their own EMS service, with more ESDs considering this move.
* Leadership position during 2021 Snowmagedden.  No leadership from the top.  No coordination or plans or resource.  Crews were out there risking their lives on impassable roads, making life and death decisions, and the only email from anyone above command that we received was some ""helpful winter driving tips"" from [www.google.com](http://www.google.com/), and a message to not be late to shift.   The ""snow kits"" we used to have disappeared years ago and were never replaced.  Medics were stranded at stations, and it was the volunteer employee association that made sure they were fed.  No 4x4 units, no tow truck response plans, etc, etc, etc.
* The failures of the COVID response are too great to even begin to explain here.  Again, the advice of experts was ignored prior to and during the pandemic.
* No plans for medication  and other supplies shortages, which have already occurred and could get worse.
* No plan for male/female/transgender bathrooms and room sharing.  Austin Fire Department addressed this years ago.  Many of our stations don't even have separate sleeping rooms for partners who may not be comfortable sleeping next to each other.
* Personally models a culture of showing up late, leaving early, taking long lunches, using tax payer resources for personal use, sexist and racist language, intimidation, etc.

This list can go on for days.

The task of appointing a new chief is a non-democratic selection by the city manager. However, the city council, which is accountable to the voters, can influence this decision. Please write to your council member and express your concerns that, as a citizen and taxpayer, you expect better government and civic services.

If you don’t believe us that Jasper Brown will do nothing to fix the disaster he has spent years helping to create, trust him, [in his own words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_zrDlaRJM).

PS. Please understand. We never want to voice our opinions in an anonymous way, and it pains us to have to do so. It is a testament to how toxic our work culture is to hearing concerns that we do not feel professionally safe writing this openly.

Please write to city council and express that you are watching this issue.  Citizens deserve better public safety services.  Taxpayers deserve fiscal accountability (the efficiency issues were too long to get into, but extremely high employee turnover costs millions).  And EMS workers, who deal with trauma beyond imagining, deserve leadership that helps them accomplish their mission, instead of multiplying their stress.

However, exercise is not a magic cure for serious clinical depression--much less bipolar disorder.  If you're advising exercise *in addition to* seeking professional help and possibly medication, great; if you're telling the OP they can get over it with exercise (or diet, or over-the-counter supplements, or getting more sleep, or positive thinking, or Jesus, or just sucking it up and getting on with life, or any of the other things well-meaning amateurs like to suggest to people with serious depression), and that they don't really need to seek professional diagnosis and treatment, that's NOT helpful.  Those things have all helped some folks with their depression, but they're no substitute for professional help.

&gt; &gt; I was one of a handful of women working for the company, and for a long time, one of only two women on the technical side of things. But my male co-workers seemed nice, I was working remotely, the job offered a lot of flexibility and freedom, and my salary was fair. I ignored those jokes my boss made about the snake in his pants.

That boss should be reprimanded and fired if he continued the behavior. Why would you *ignore* the jokes, that's exactly the moment you tell someone not to cross the line, or you double-down and make a joke about your clam. Choose one, not passive-aggression. *Oh, I know, maybe I can complain about it in pandodaily years later.* Yes, your boss should already know not to do that, but maybe you need to tell them or their boss or HR, when they cross the line instead of brooding about it two years.

&gt; &gt; Danielle is an engineer at Apple — and like many of the women in the company, she works on a male-dominated team. On a Tuesday morning in July, when men on her team began to joke that an office intruder was coming to rape everybody...

I snickered, and I don't even know the whole joke. Just the words ""rape everybody"" got me. And I don't see how that is offensive toward women in particular. Now I want to work at Apple.

&gt; The standard response Tess Rinearson gives to recruiters when they call her roughly once a month on behalf of Uber:...

Circlejerk examples about how some SJWs don't like Uber in particular. You didn't take a job at a company that asked you to interview there, *therefore that company is sexist*. Okay. That makes sense if you like putting the cart before the horse. No examples provided of Uber doing anything wrong to its female tech employees--just some women saying why they wouldn't work on Uber (likely based on this echo chamber of bullshit articles about why Uber is bad, maybe another article can cite this one: look, Uber is bad because these female tech employees decided not to work there because they think it's bad).

This is like writing a one-star Yelp review because the restaurant was closed so they didn't get to eat at all.

&gt; That’s right. Uber is so gender-hostile, turning them down has become a *meme*.

Lol. Yeah totes a *meme*.

&gt; Then there are boneheads like John Greathouse who wrote that women should hide their gender if they want to get funding:

&gt; &gt; [W]omen in today’s tech world should create an online presence that obscures their gender...

&gt; &gt; ...As a reader, I appreciate a book when I don’t know the author’s gender and haven’t formed a concrete image of him or her. If I enjoy a particular work, I then research the writer to better understand how their background and motivations shaped their fiction….

&gt; &gt; ...however unfair it may be – I would suggest that if you are a woman raising capital, you might consider not including photos of your team in your pitch deck. If you identify your team via their initials (men and women), you effectively strip out all preconceptions related to race, ethnicity and gender. In your LinkedIn profile, Twitter account, email address and online correspondence use your initials (or a unisex name) and eliminate photos.

If you read his article, the entire point is that people are biased, and this would be a way to get around the bias in the interim, as long as the bias exists. It's not as if he is saying he agrees with the bias, he is suggesting an unfair way to get around it.

The only thing missing is that he should have taken it a step further and suggest *everybody* do this and that lenders make this part of their process to remove bias entirely. Of course, lenders probably want to know who you are as a person, not so they can be biased for or against you (even though they may), but to see if you're a fucking eccentric weirdo who doesn't know what they're doing and is going to run a company into the ground (people think they can judge a person).

&gt; Then there are the boneheads of the week: Two dudes in Australia who have opened a men’s only coworking space. It’s not sexism! It’s an innovative way to address men’s anxieties about the workplace! Nevermind the startup world in Australia is 75% male.

&gt; You’re going to love the justification:

&gt; &gt; [Cofounder Samuel] Monaghan told Junkee that there were “a couple of things that got us to this point.”
&gt; &gt; “We’d been working in coffee shops and at home and it wasn’t that conducive to working,” Monaghan said. “We both had a mate who ended up in a violent situation with his wife. He pushed his wife over.”
&gt; &gt; According to Monaghan, domestic violence is an issue that “stems from depression in many cases”.
&gt; &gt; “Depression and suicide result from a lack of social support and community. Having a space where they [men] can be men is more of a preventative measure,” Monaghan said. “Healthy, happy men don’t hit their wives.”

&gt; Wait… let me get this straight. The way to make men more sensitive and less aggressive is to sequester them with other men. If the woman wasn’t there, they couldn’t beat her, right?

First, what's actually wrong with a men's only coworking space? I can see the need for a women's only coworking space, so you don't get hit on by horny men every few minutes. Not seeing the problem in either direction.

cmi7lm7,"I think that the protesters blocking traffic and throwing road signs are probably the best case scenario for this kind of protest. Portland protesters have been extremely non-violent. Of course there are one or two anarchist kids with stupid masks on who over react, but marching in highways is nothing new. Bloody Sunday, 1965, for reference. Likewise in public parks, in Chicago in 1966--and those are just *just* two that top lists of hundreds that happened during the civil rights movement. And if you want to talk about marches protesting the vietnam war we can do that too. 

The whole point is to stop the status quo without damaging businesses or property. To get attention, to demonstrate that this is a real problem, that is being ignored by the powers that be. How the justice department and general public react is tantamount to what manifests in a walk or rally, and I've been disappointed in the Portland Community and by the Portland Police in the last few months--and especially in the last few days. 

Yes, again, there is hypothetical danger to other citizens when marches block traffic. But AGAIN, the same is absolutely true for car wrecks, public parades, marathons, etc. The building across the street from the Schnitz is low income housing. There are ambulances there weekly. Response times are slower every time roads are shut down for turkey trots, the Portland Marathon, holiday parades... not to mention just every fucking day from 4-6pm when all of downtown portland gets off work and goes back to whatever suburb they can afford to reside in.  
 
So unless you're willing to say those also affect your personal rights, I think you're full of shit. 

What I think you're missing here too, in a big way, is that the African American community (and other minorities) do not feel like our justice system works for them.  Locally even, Aaron Campbell called the police in 2012 and officers responded: ""Frashour shot Campbell, 25, with an AR-15 rifle after other officers had talked the suicidal man, who was despondent over his brother's death, into walking out of his girlfriend's Northeast Portland apartment. Campbell came out walking backward with his hands behind his head."" And he was shot. Make Brown is currently in the spotlight. But since his death, how many more boys have been treated in the same way? Trayvon Martin. Vonderrit Myers Jr. Deandre Joshua. And more. It's not okay, and why would anyone trust this system at this point. 

And as far as the union part, I read it as you boosting yourself up. ""Hey, me, I'm a good guy. I'm pro labor and in a union so you know I'm reasonable, fellow portlanders... but blocking the streets is blocking my rights, no matter how ironic."" And I don't appreciate it. It just so happens I know you, and I know a lot about you, and as a result I reacted with anger--and for that I apologize. But no one has taken away your rights, or inconvenienced you re: Ferguson. And your hypothetical inconveniences are crap. There are things more important than just you, and I won't apologize for that. 

EDIT: Cameron Whitten, a local up and coming politician and activist, wrote another excellent article today, in bitch magazine. He is thoughtful, well researched, experienced, and the furthest thing from a name caller. This city is so lucky to have him. He notes a total of 14 African American teenagers have been shot since Mike Brown. And if you want to counter that with ""well cops shoot white teenagers too,"" go ahead. You'll sound like a jerk, and even if you find the numbers and stories to support such a statement, you should still be upset that this is an ""acceptable"" practice.  The police should be held accountable. The grand jury proceedings are under investigation. The system is like a bunch of circled wagons, and it is embarrassing.  http://bitchmagazine.org/post/embracing-the-aftermath-of-ferguson

Can say you shouldn't do that? Are you kidding? Get off the street, get off the sidewalk, don't put your hands up? I said it before and will say it again, I know and love certain cops, by no means think all cops are bad people. But all this is evidence of a system that is accountable to no one.

Here's the ""but"" though.

The conversations I'd overhear my uncle have with my dad about the stuff he did was absolutely horrible.  They'd laugh and chuckle, but for me it was super WTF.  A quick example is my uncle showed up to a jumper on a bridge, suicide thing, black guy.  He was the first one on the scene and had a conversation with the guy before anyone else, while the rest were still showing up.

And ultimately, that's your problem.   That's how a LOT of people view the cops right now.  It has the shitty effect of bringing \_those\_ kind of folks to the job because that's just where they go.  So you're fighting an uphill battle to begin with.

jie44br,"I did 9 years in NYC and moved to SD last June. It was an adjustment FOR SURE. But after spending my 20s living it up in Manhattan, SD has been great for my thirties. It takes time getting used to how quiet it is, the car-depence, and the lack of cultural events/diversity, but San Diego has a ton of things to offer that NYC can't compare to. Year-round nice weather means you can have a more active outdoor lifestyle (and if you're like me, that can have a major impact on seasonal depression). I find it decently easy to make friends and meet people in San Diego because my 'NY confidence' means i don't care about going to bars or museums solo and people here are very friendly so I strike up convos all the time! San Diego is near a ton of amazing national/state parks and South western cities that make for fantastic roadtrips. Plus if you've been wanting to get an animal but were reluctant in nyc, San Diego is the most pet-friendly place I've ever seen!

At the end of the day though, the city you choose should depend on the lifestyle you want. Both are great places to live so good luck with your decision.

Lastly I'll add: although I haven't been here long, I don't find myself missing NY as much as I expected.

fa13bih,"&gt; I dont think you understand what you are talking about with this whole ""limit firearms to x rate"". Im going to nitpick your non-proposals when they dont even come close to making sense around a topic.

What's hard to understand about if you can fire it faster than x bullets per y time or simply a firing rate of z then we put it in one category and not the other.

I literally only brought it up because I'm aware that in the gun community there is contention over ""assault weapon"" as there's no single agreed upon term and creating this sort of classification system in the legal system goes a long way towards rectifying that issue.

My fire rate example isn't even meant to be a specific real world application but an example of the type of classifications you can create to target specific problems (ie. if the concern is about how often a person has to reload and how fast they can empty a magazine/clip into a crowd then use the area of concern to identify the classification of weapon both so laws don't create ambiguity, and so that the merits of the classification can be discussed in terms of impact to existing weapons).

&gt; Hand wave your shit to someone else. Dont get upset cause im pointing out how silly some of the things you are ""high level discussing"" are.

You do get I'm saying ""high level"" as in broad overview and not as in difficult to understand, right? Cause you seem to be taking it very personally that I want to stay in broad concepts and not shit fight over specifics they way you're trying to drag the conversation.

&gt; Because there is extremely little evidence that even an outright ban and confiscation of firearms would have a statistically significant impact on suicide rates. You are confused because you havent even thought through what you are talking about and Im pointing that out to you.

Dude. You clearly aren't following this conversation if you think anything I'm proposing is about straight bans or even bans in general.

fr5f11i,"House hunting can be utterly soul crushing.  My wife and I loved to Waltham from Los Angeles. I grew up in Waltham, and although I always said I’d never be back here - here I am. Anyway... we stayed in my parents basement. Without windows. During the winter. After leaving 75 &amp; sunny. To say seasonal depression is real is an understatement. We moved here in September of 2017, and got preapproved by October. The first few weeks we just sent houses back and forth while we were at work. Usually there was a deal breaker in nearly every place for one of us. By November we were going to open houses. We probably went to about 12 different open houses in the south shore area, made three separate offers. Every single offer was declined because someone paid X more without inspection. By February I was over it. I found myself asking my wife nearly every day if we made a huge mistake coming back here. We had a great life in LA. Then our current place popped up. My aunt, who was our real estate agent called up and said she had a client interested in selling their home. We looked at the house and minus the kitchen, which was a disaster, the house was ok - at best. I was so beaten down from this process I rolled over and told my wife I trust her that we can make this place ours, even though I didn’t really agree. 2 years later, I love this house. We gutted the kitchen, knocked down some walls, and just overall upgraded everything. 

I still miss LA, but I love my house and I can’t imagine living in any of the other “perfect” houses - this one is ours. 

Some advice

-	try not to spend what you’re approved for. Our mortgage was higher then we wanted, at its highest we were paying like $3300/mo, after refinancing we’re in a better spot. Still high - but better. 
-	look at what’s around the location - bus stops, food, schools - even proximity to the highway. 
-	I started looking for problems, and not opportunities. My dad is a contractor - so he would be quick to point out issues, but think about what are serious issues vs minor fixes.

fnp463d,"I am pushing back against this lockdown continuing past June, yes. I am not pushing back against the need for social distancing. I am not advocating for life going back to what it was in January. That is clearly what I spelled out in my previous post. There is a middle ground that every government is attempting to find and implement so that more people don't die from economic fallout than what would be saved by locking down society for months on end.

Unless you are calling every government out there who are planning reopen strategies within the next month or two irrational, in which case you are the one who is clearly disconnected with reality. 

My argument, just like Cuomo outlined yesterday and just like the Spanish, Italian, Chinese and UK government's positions are, is that some sectors will need to be reopened so that people can start working and earning again to provide a. an income to support themselves and b. income to the state so they have money to support maintaining critical infrastructure, social programs and to continue providing relief to those affected by this virus.

My argument is also based off the knowledge that the death rate for this virus is around if not less than 1%. The latest research on this has lowered the mortality rate lower and lower. By allowing some section of society, most likely the younger population who are not at risk of dying from this virus, to return back to their jobs, we will alleviate the immense stress this virus is putting on people and the city's savings and ability to survive.

By enforcing strict social distancing measures and forcing people to wear masks, plus keeping elderly and at risk people isolated, and keeping certain luxury sectors shut down, we can kickstart some part of the economy to allow people and the city to generate income and avoid certain disaster worse than the Great Depression that would kill thousands more 'innocent people' than just people who would get sick. How many innocent people, or what percentage of the population, should be allowed to starve and die so your vision of saving everybody from a virus is completed? Do you now understand there's a delicate balance and both sides need to be considered here?


There will be no post pandemic society to flourish if we lock down society for 4/5/6 more months. It is almost impossible. Economics and science both agree on this. Flattening the curve has never been about lowering infection count but to stop hospitals from getting overwhelmed. That can continue while easing off the lockdowns to some extent.


All your argument has been is that I will be inconvenienced by a lockdown continuing endlessly which is a blatant disregard for all the other socioeconomic factors a lockdown affects. Innocent people will die if a lockdown continues for another half a year. The virus is going to become a part of life for us until a vaccine is released, and we will have to deal with striking a balance between reducing damage caused by economic shutdown, and damage caused by the virus. That is inevitable. You cannot ignore the economic impact just because the impact can't be neatly summarized like covid infections and deaths can.",comment,NYC,1.0

iut7vr3,"When I took a class in mountaineering in the early 2000s, we were required to read an annually released booklet called Accidents in North American Mountaineering (now called Accidents in North American Climbing). There was one story that I remember to this day about a man with some limited hiking experience who wanted to climb Denali. He thought it was fine to carry a broomstick to catch himself in case he fell into a crevasse. Survived the attempt due to massive idiot's luck.

ETA: Ok, did some digging. I misremembered a bit. I think the course instructors who gave us a reenactment used a broomstick. Climber used a wooden 2x2. Depression may have played a factor in the choices made.

&gt;McCarthy opted to go against Miller’s advice and climb solo up the West Buttress route starting on May 17. McCarthy carried only an 8-foot 2""x2"" piece of wood for crevasse protection. A 2""x2"" spanning seven feet would support approximately 100 pounds at its midpoint. McCarthy weighed 230 pounds. Combining the weight of his pack and sled, the total weight was closer to 330 pounds. McCarthy was observed carrying the 2 ""x2"" in his hands at right angles to his direction of travel. Even if it held him, it would have proved ineffectual since it was carried parallel to the crevasses.

Traffic is downright awful (10 min to go 1-2 miles is common, and it can be way worse), public transportation can snarl and take a lot of time, and it's a gamble to bike on the streets (there are great bike lanes out there, but not everywhere - and drivers do not care if you're on a bike or on foot).

I didn't have time to find a new place on short notice, but resolved to do it one year later. I spent a weekend last summer walking around Tacoma to see if it was a viable alternative - the city seems livable, and the best neighborhoods there are more affordable than my Queen Anne apartment. Plus, the downtown doesn't smell like piss, which is a nice bonus.

And then the Rona happened. Not wanting to either deal with movers or find a new place during a pandemic, I reluctantly gave up my plans to move, and realized I'd have to dip into my savings to afford this year's inevitable rent increase... and maybe move out in 2021.

Fortunately, the same company that usually gouges me with price increases every year chose not to do so this year, due to the depressed market - I was able to renew my lease for the same price as before. So now I'm back to where I was a year ago, hoping to move in eleven months.

That this city has decided it no longer wants to have a functioning police department is also a factor in my desire to move.

d4t0veb,"&gt;the argument I was addressing is that pharmacists do not get to decide whether drugs are prescribed or not.

No one is arguing that should be the case. A pharmacist would not be overriding the doctors decision, they are not revoking the prescription. The patient is free to go elsewhere if a pharmacist refuses.

&gt; ergo: if a doctor has prescribed a suicide pill, a pharmacist has no ethical right to refuse to dispense the pill

This doesn't really follow based on what you said. Just because a doctor has filled out a script, which allows the patient access to a drug, doesn't mean someone else should be required to provide access. What if the method of suicide is euthanasia via injection? Could we force a nurse to kill someone because ""It is their job"", after all how different is it really from starting an IV?

What about pharmacists who refuse to give out the medications used in [lethal injection for the death penalty](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pharmacy-groups-balk-supplying-lethal-injection-drugs-n332656)? Should they, too, required to dispense these drugs?

It goes both ways too [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Senate_Bill_5) tried to do the exact same thing with abortion clinics, but instead force them to offer other services.

&gt;The bill would mandate that a doctor who performs abortions have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, and to require that clinics meet the same standards as other surgical health-care facilities in the state.

2u4uk2,"A little clarification on the whole Reddit Boston marathon witch-hunt narrative... Given that this was on the front page of reddit, I might as well refute a few myths about Reddit and the Boston Bombing.

People around here seem to think that Reddit was partly responsible for getting the FBI to release the pictures on April 18, leading to the death of Sean Collier and the shoot-out in Watertown by the brothers Tsarnaev. 

The feds did this because reddit had pinned the crime on Sunil Tripathi, a suicide victim most didn't know was dead, the story goes. The narrative continues that the feds didn't want the public harassing Tripathi's family and released the pictures in an attempt to exonerate Tripathi and avoid future witch hunts. 

But the fact is that on the night of the shoot-out, the police were still identifying Dzokhar Tsarnaev as Sunil Tripathi over their radios. I heard them spell out his name as they were in pursuit of Tsarnaev. 

The police did not know who the bombers were until after the death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Sunil Tripathi was a suspect. 

The feds did not release the pictures because of reddit. They did so in what was most likely a terrible decision to appease the media, and it most likely resulted in more chaos instead of less. 

While it is unfortunate that redditors used the information of the boards to find and harass the suspects, the narrative that reddit caused the FBI to release information to protect innocent suspects identified by reddit is ludicrous, first because they still thought Tripathi was a suspect leading up to the shoot-out and second because the idea that the FBI would ever be influenced by spurious claims on reddit is laughable. 

Now, I'm not a fan of the actions of the FBI during that particular crisis, if only because Collier's death was totally avoidable and shutting down the city was an overreaction and absurd. But the narrative that reddit somehow influenced their investigation by creating a hysteria they felt needed to die down is simply not true. If it is true, then the FBI in Boston is even worse than we think it is.

**MASS SHOOTING CASUALTIES IN THE U.S. IN 2018**

* **426 verified mass shootings**

* **528 people killed**

* **1,549 people wounded**

* **2,077 total casualties (killed &amp; wounded)**

The figures above only represent victims of [mass shootings](http://www.massshootingtracker.org/about#massshooting) (when four or more people were shot in an event, or related series of events without a cooling off period). Not included are victims of shootings where three or fewer people were shot. For more information, check out GrC's [**Mass Shooting Tracker**](https://www.massshootingtracker.org/data/2018).

&amp;nbsp;

**Bonus Mass Shooting Fun Facts for 2018:**

* There was an average of **1.17 mass shootings per day** in 2018.

* The **top 10 states for mass shootings** in 2018 (# per million people) were: **Alabama** (3.48), **Tennessee** (3.39), **Illinois** (3.21), **Missouri** (3.10), **Louisiana** (2.78),  **Oklahoma** (2.28), **Arkansas** (1.98), **Nevada** (1.96), **Colorado** (1.76), **Florida** (1.69).

* Of the 426 mass shootings in 2018, **158 (37%) involved domestic violence or juvenile casualties**. 


&amp;nbsp;

**DOMESTIC, ACCIDENTAL &amp; SUICIDE SHOOTINGS IN THE U.S. IN 2018**

Of course, mass shootings account for only a small fraction of the total number of shootings that occur every day, many of which involve domestic violence, accidents, suicides, children, and a *much* smaller number of justified ""defensive gun uses"" (DGUs).  On average, **96 Americans are killed and 246 injured with guns every day** [[source]](http://www.bradycampaign.org/key-gun-violence-statistics), resulting in approximately **10,403 gunshot casualties each month.** In the U.S. between 2012 and 2017 – the last year for which CDC data is available – ***1 of every 75 deaths in the U.S. was caused by gunshot*** [[sources]](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/wiki/year_by_year_figures).

&amp;nbsp;

**DEFENSIVE GUN USES (DGUs) IN THE U.S. IN 2018**

By comparison, in 2018 there were **1,443 apparently justified DGUs in the U.S.** where armed civilian gun owners attempted to prevent crimes (including incidents where no shots were fired), as presented in the table below (the figures below do not include incidents where unarmed citizens successfully defended themselves against armed criminals, incidents where armed law enforcement officers defended themselves, or [""bad DGUs""](https://old.reddit.com/r/bad_dgu/)):

&amp;nbsp;

The figures above indicate that in 2018, ***incidents where Americans shot themselves, a family member, an intimate partner or an innocent bystander (unintentionally) were 23 times more common than incidents where Americans used a gun in a justified attempt to stop a crime (see [**chart**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQUiF2_xuhkq2soBopINRfvBcJQF8ff0KQkklvVa134POfwszcfPUjpH6wCNFtN46r3gf_nqpnIdNjc/pubchart?oid=208007580&amp;format=interactive)).*** This includes reported DGU incidents where Americans used guns to prevent petty larceny.  Even if gun suicides are excluded, Americans were still 3.3 times more likely to shoot themselves, a family member, an intimate partner or an innocent bystander (unintentionally) than to use a gun in a justified attempt to stop a crime (including petty larceny). ***Women were approximately 100 times more likely to be killed by a man with a gun than to use a firearm in self defense*** [[source]](https://www.thenation.com/article/a-new-study-debunks-the-nras-claim-that-guns-protect-women/).

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, there were approximately 250,000 to 500,000 cases in 2018 in which guns were stolen from private owners, more than enough to provide a weapon for every instance of gun violence in the country [[source]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/gun-theft-us-firearm-survey). This indicates that ***gun owners were at least 173 times more likely to have a gun stolen by criminals than to use a gun in an attempt to stop a crime.***

ew9plgt,"&gt; No, I'm saying that it's hypocritical to say our policies on immigration can be modernized to reflect the concerns of the current era but that the right to bear arms is somehow immutable.

That's nice. Too bad just saying something doesn't make it true. We've changed our immigration policies over the decades because we KNOW that we need more low skill workers during some years and DO NOT need more during others. Like I said, do you honestly think that open borders would have been a good thing for AMERICAN CITIZENS during the great depression!? 

What changing conditions warrant denying citizens their constitutional rights? Oh, you forgot that the right to bear arms is a constitutional right for CITIZENS and immigration is a PRIVILEGE, not a right, for non citizens? 

Why should we put the needs of the creditor class, massive corporations, and the third world before the needs and interests of our citizens? 

Tell you what. Literally no one is stopping you from paying for an illegal's healthcare, assuming you're not 14 that is. You can do it tomorrow. Why don't you? Why do you insist on forcing ME to pay? This is a country of citizens, not a battered homeless shelter for the world's poor.

Point 2 - While I agree that we should look at localized US data, we can't ignore the fact that other countries, with significantly less access to firearms have twice the suicide rate.

Point 3 - There aren't ""arguments"" for gun ownership. There is a CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT to gun ownership.  It exists to keep check on oppressive governments.  It has created a weird cultural dynamic, but it is one of the defining things about America that makes us unique.

Point 4 - Do you believe suicide is a sin or a crime?

I live in Oregon.  We have ""Right to Die"".  I believe in that.  I don't believe killing ones self is a sin.

- it's the holidays - suicidal people show up in the ER regularly around the holidays
- not enough providers graduating to support the growing patient population 
- not enough other hospital workers of various departments 
- hospitals are all about money so they are going to cut, underpay and under staff

I moved here from Florida about 10 years and 5 months ago. Got dumped, laid off and diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety all within the span of 6 months. I needed to get out of Florida and for the most part, my stay here had been ok, but I hadn't been able to find a job anywhere.

Quickly realizing how absolutely broke I was, I sold all of the things that I could sell, worked every freelance job I could work, and pinched every penny by eating nothing but rice and canned beans for 3 months.

I know that lots of people had it worse than I do, as it very apparent by the abundant homeless population. My heart truly goes out to them

I’m reached out to all of you 10 years ago to plead with any of you who might know of anywhere to get a job. I had a degree in mass communications and experience in my field, but it seemed like no matter what I did, I couldn't get a job anywhere. I got turned down by Target twice.

I honestly didn’t know where to go or who to turn to. Anything, anything at all would have helped. Even just comments to tell me to keep my head up because at that point I needed it.

That's when many of you reached out to me and gave me so leads for jobs and ways to address my mental health. I can't believe its been 10 years. We've still got Comrade Trump as president and that's pretty damn lousy, but you wouldn't believe how my life has turned out, and how far I have come. 

I started working a dishwasher part time and doing some side gigs with a local media company. From there I ended up on a project team for a large ad campaign at the marketing company and was able to quit my dishwashing job. After about a year and a half of 60-70hr weeks (my money problems were gone!) we launched our campaign and it was a smashing success winning many industry awards! 

On the side, because my income was non-existent, I was about to sign up for OHP and get linked up with a therapist through Multnomah County Health Services. It took some help and a bit of phone calls and various forms to really get things going but this ended up being the best therapist I've ever seen. I'd seen a bunch and we often seemed to discuss life but not really go anywhere. Maybe it was just me who was ready to dive into my own problems, but they seemed like a perfect reflector, leading me to realize choices I needed to make in my life and helped me to establish new patterns for interacting and being aware of my feelings. As I made more income and gained my own health insurance, I continued to pay out of pocket to see this therapist. Over the course of 3 years, focusing a lot on myself I was able to wean off of my medications as I had established new and healthy routines.

Anyways, back to the professional development, due to the success on the big media campaign, and the fact that I had helped with a lot of the gritty work on the ground along with offering some creative contributions that were appreciated by a few of the project directors, and the work schmoozing events that happened after it debuted, I had formed a decent network of who's who in town in my field. I managed to get a really great paying job at a new avante garde ad firm, who also helped pay for me to get my masters in strategic communications in an evening and weekend program through UO's satellite program through their school of journalism here in town. About 6 years after I was here crying on the bus, I had my masters degree, lots of connections, and a great basis to start off on my own consulting company. I've worked with a variety of entities throughout the region as an contractor and make more than I could have ever imagined.

It's now going on 10 years and in happen stance I came across a young person on a job I was consulting for, who had just moved here from Florida, down on their luck, with a degree in digital mass media. Thinking of my own past and my own difficulties I reached out to them to see if they wanted to help me on a different project that I thought they'd be a great fit for. Well they did awesome with the job and nailed it just as the client was looking for. No surprise after that I was able to get them a paying living wage internship with a company I frequently work with.. and I just had to be thankful for how life has unfolded in the most unexpected of ways. I am so grateful for the opportunities and help I got from you when I needed it most.",submission,Portland,1.0

ds2qybi,"Hello. The mental health of America: fort bend has a comprehensive list of resources located here: http://mhafbc.org/Resource-Guide

I recommend looking into the behavioral health clinics (pgs 38-40). In addition, Legacy (as noted by another commenter) and Montrose center are great behavioral health centers (Montrose specifically works with LGBTQ issues but accepts everybody). 

I would connect with 211 if you are in an immediate crisis. The resource guide also has numbers to other crisis lines and the suicide line. 211 also has a database of every thing you can imagine including mental health resources based off a sliding scale (rent assistance, knowledge of food assistance, utility assistance) . If you find it easier to seek out resources in this way, I would call 211 and get as many resources as they can give you (making sure that these resources are sliding scale).

f44gno6,"Why, what's the real harm?

Do you want to take a guess at how many kids each year are injured in football and cheerleading? How many 14 year old girls dropped dead from heart attacks or ended up paralyzed in this last year?

What type of psychological and biological problems are we granting to children through gambling in video games, and addictive video games?

What type of long term risks do we expose children to through social media? Like, I dunno, does Instagram cause a huge increase in suicides and mental illness among teenagers? What if we found out that suicide rates and depression were skyrocketing, with prevalence of these problems being directly linked to social media activity?

Through tradition we tolerate *insane* levels of risk for children, risk that's completely unnecessary and that could be easily reduced by better regulation and safety equipment. 

I don't see vaping as fundamentally different. Prohibition *clearly* didn't stop kids from trying or using marijuana - it *clearly* doesn't stop kids from trying or using tobacco - so why are we pretending it's doing this with vaping?

&gt;YET ANOTHER ANTICIPATED court battle, the suit as yet unfiled, will ask the judiciary to review ""a number of continuing violations of state-church separation in the public school systems of the United States, including the unconstitutional practice of the PTA's continual prayer in schools."" She first became interested in the PTA's activities when Robin invited her to come to a meeting May 3 to hear her play in the school orchestra. The newly installed president started to lead a prayer, prompting O'Hair to rush to the stage to protest.

&gt;Last week she charged that the PTA president shoved her during the incident and swore out an assault complaint against Mrs. Joe Muchison Jr. ""I don't object to religion,"" O'Hair shrugs. ""Everyone Is entitled to a little craziness in their lives if they want it ""I do object to the government financing their craziness or otherwise supporting it as part of the government."" The fallout from O'Hair's earlier battles still affects her life. In fact, it was largely responsible for her move to Austin. 


&gt;SHE STILL FACES a contempt-of-court conviction in Maryland where she was charged with assaulting 22 policemen. She fled the state in the furious aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court prayer decision and jumped a personal recognizance bond posted in Hawaii when she was losing her battle against extradition to Maryland. O'Hair says she went to Mexico where she worked as a teacher and there met Richard F. O'Hair. They eventually came to Austin as the nearest state capital from which to fight the extradition. 

&gt;Winning on ""a freak legal technicality,"" they stayed, at least in part because ""people left us alone."" O'Hair now says she doesn't believe her battles could have been fought effectively with less abrasiveness, less deliberately shocking behavior. 

&gt;""Honest to God to use an expression I do believe in justice,"" O'Hair said. ""I believe in those platitudes my parents taught me... ""There is no wav I'm going to sell myself out represent myself as a clown ...i don't believe in violence, I've never struck another person, including at the bingo game the other night. ""I'm covered with bruises, but I didn't go in there swinging and I didn't hit anyone - it would have been suicidal."" 

&gt;SON JON GARTH injects, ""The problem is now she's too old and can't run fast enough when they start reacting violently."" O'Hair's speech has at least been violent on occasions. She delights in peppering her remarks with four-letter words and curses. ""Colorful language, sure. I'm guilty,"" she laughs, ""I'm an artist with that It can be used for great effect"" Many of O'Hair's actions smack of that deliberate calculation. Her bingocrashing could be a perfect example. 

&gt;That afternoon, William Murray staged a press conference to denounce his mother's legal complaint against a former atheist center employee. That story probably would have appeared on newspaper front pages and made television news broadcasts, but O'Hair's dramatic confrontation at San Jose Catholic Church later that same day upstaged the business-suited William and his newly formed breakaway atheist organization, a philanthropic venture called Second Foundation. 



&gt;COULD HER LIFE have been easier, more settled, less turbulent? Could the path have been smoothed for William, Jon Garth, and young Robin if O'Hair bad been willing to give up some of her abrasiveness? ""I was a public figure long ago and my family has been full of public figures,"" 

&gt;O'Hair says without hesitation. ""...The very first thing I can ever remember getting involved in was called the Roosevelt Recovery League... ""When men were drafted for the Second World War, I was one of the persons who was doing the draft registration. And I had a private letter from (John) Kennedy one time for my campaign work for him when he was running for president. And I did that House un-American activities thing... ""I also fought for equal wages for women. I started that in 1934 when I was 16 years old... being In the newspapers wasn't new to me when the focus was on Bible-prayer... ""My entire family was in the union movement. My God...lt would be peculiar to me if I would be sitting home some place."" 

&gt;O'Hair said people's hatred of her. her causes, even her family, is ""their problem."" Of being held up as public villain, as a professional bad guy to much of middle America, O'Hair said, ''Honest, if you've got a sense of humor and you understand it's their problem that's the only thing that's necessary. ""All of their threat all of their vilification, all of their, hatred...they have to wrestle with that. I'm not hating anybody. As long as that's absolutely understood, then it's no sweat.""

Ahh, so it's actually Dr. O'Hair, receiving a doctorate in jurisprudence. That article doesn't get into how often she was suing governmental organizations over prayers or mentions of a God. Her crusade against The City of Austin and The State of Texas didn't let up over the next 15 years. The articles [similar to this one](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/88028260/atheist-group-files-lawsuit-on-tax/) in the Statesman archive are too numerous to mention. But she went too far, and some in her organization ended up suing over abuse and financial mismanagement. A former Austin mayor was the lawyer for the plaintiffs. [The case dragged on for years](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/88028781/atheist-group-closes-center-in-n/) and by 1987 there was a schism which forced the American Atheists to move from their longtime headquarters on Hancock Dr. to the building in the OP video on Cameron Rd. 

Back in 1998 after Madalyn and her family disappeared the Austin Chronicle printed a [timeline of events](https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/1998-11-20/520649/) which tells what happened next. Quoting some of it:

&gt;1988: American Atheists Inc. General Headquarters (AAGHQ) opens for business in Austin.

&gt;1993: Madalyn and son Jon Garth Murray, in midst of litigation over the ownership of an atheist publication called The Truth Seeker, begin working to hide assets in anticipation of losing a lawsuit filed against them in San Diego.

&gt;1993: David Waters begins working at AAGHQ.

&gt;Jan. 1994: The Charles E. Stevens Atheist Library is shipped from Houston to Kansas City and put in storage to prevent it from being seized by the plaintiffs in the Truth Seeker lawsuit.

&gt;March 30, 1994: Waters withdraws $7,000 from AAGHQ payroll account and purchases a cashier's check made out to himself in the amount of $3,500. It is the first of several transactions that Waters makes while Madalyn, Jon, and Robin are in San Diego. In all, he takes $54,000 from the atheist accounts.

&gt;April 29, 1994: Waters is charged with theft by appropriation, a second degree felony.

&gt;May 22, 1995: Waters pleads guilty to theft. He receives 10 years' probation and is ordered to pay restitution and to have no contact with Madalyn, Jon, and Robin.

&gt;July 1995: Danny Fry, an acquaintance of Waters, arrives in Austin.

&gt;Aug. 1995: Madalyn, Jon, and Robin take vacation to Virginia; they later return to Austin.

&gt;Aug. 27, 1995: Jon, Robin and Madalyn leave Austin for the last time. Leaving a note on the door at AAGHQ telling employees they are gone for a while, the three go to San Antonio.

&gt;Sept. 4, 1995: Ad appears in San Antonio Express-News: ""88 Benz 300 SEL $15,000 cash. Firm."" Ad leaves Jon's cell phone number. San Antonio real estate agent Mark Sparrow answers ad. The seller, a man who calls himself Jon but doesn't fit Jon Garth Murray's description, tells Sparrow he's in a hurry to sell, and that he can be contacted at Bonnie Jeane's, a San Antonio bar.

&gt;Sept. 5, 1995: Sparrow buys Jon's Mercedes in a parking lot next to the Warren Inn apartments in San Antonio, the place where, according to the Express-News, Fry was living.

&gt;Sept. 16, 1995: Waters buys a white Cadillac El Dorado from a San Antonio couple for $13,000 in cash.

&gt;Sept. 22, 1995: Jon orders $600,000 worth of gold coins from San Antonio jeweler Cory Ticknor. The coins are paid for with money wired to a San Antonio bank from another bank in New Jersey. The funds originated from one of the atheists' bank accounts in New Zealand.

&gt;Sept. 29, 1995: At 12:24 pm, Jon makes a seven minute-long phone call to AAGHQ. It is the last phone call he made on his cellular phone. Later that day, Jon takes delivery of $500,000 in gold coins from Ticknor. He never collected the final $100,000 worth of coins from Ticknor.

&gt;Sept. 30, 1995: 2:30pm, Danny Fry calls his daughter in Florida for the last time.

&gt;Mid-December, 1995: Two dogs, Gannon and Shannon, owned by Jon and Robin, disappear from a locked, fenced enclosure behind AAGHQ.

&gt;Sept. 24, 1996: Bill Murray files a missing persons report with Austin Police Department. Police begin investigation.

&gt;Oct. 1996: Robin's 1985 Porsche 944 is found abandoned at the Austin airport.

&gt;Dec. 1996: IRS revokes tax-exempt status for two atheist nonprofits, the Charles E. Stevens American Atheist Library and Archives Inc., and the Society of Separationists Inc.

&gt;Jan. 31, 1997: Bill Murray abandons his effort to control the estate of the missing trio.

&gt;December 1997: IRS seizes the $100,000 in gold coins Jon left with Ticknor.

&gt;July 1998: The house at 3702 Greystone Drive that Madalyn, Jon, and Robin shared is sold for $240,000 to satisfy creditors.

&gt;Sept. 1998: Atheist leaders agree to sell their 17,500-square-foot building on Cameron Road to AIDS Services of Austin for $800,000.

&gt;Oct. 2, 1998: Waters contacts The Austin Chronicle.

&gt;Oct. 7, 1998: Waters shows dozens of pages of correspondence dating back to 1993 and 1994 that Waters took from AAGHQ.

&gt;Oct. 27, 1998: Waters has a probation hearing in front of Travis Co. Magistrate Jim Coronado, who lectures Waters that his cable bill of $85 is too high, and that ""if your interest is in staying out of jail,"" he'd better get current on his restitution payments to the American Atheists.

gi71nm6,"tl;dr-- Yes and no. This is why the study of psychology is important.

Let me preface my answer by saying there is NOT, as far as I know, a straightforward, condensed answer.

Humans are prosocial creatures by nature. The hormones in our body promote contact with each other (i.e. touch + oxytocin, bonding with a mother and child). 

I will separate isolation into two parts: (a) physical and (b) social.

Physical isolation is as it sounds. This can be by choice, or in a situation such as now with a pandemic. It is why there is a rise in depression cases. 

Social isolation can be both physically and when you are surrounded by other people. It is a mental state. 

Referring to controlling loneliness: the Big Five personality traits are helpful in understanding a bit about this. Some people are less social and this is not adverse. However more extroverted have an advantage in making friends and the prosocial contact I mentioned. Thus, in the case of controlling loneliness, there are behavioral methods such as ""positive reappraisal"" and ""cognitive reappraisal"" that can help. 

In the 12-17 and 18-25 range, women are more likely (than men) to be neurotic. Neuroticism is linked to mood disorders. \[i don't have data on non-binary and transgender big 5 traits, but I could look it up if you are interested\]. 

Mental Health Disorders can have a great impact on perceived loneliness. Some people lose (or cannot maintain) relationships with friends and family. Such, the ""control"" you speak of is a much greater hurdle than a neuro-typical person. 

If you are interested in psychology, I do encourage you to be aware of mental health and the toll it takes on people with mental health disorders lives. \[if you are among them, I encourage you not to lump all of those with your diagnosis into the same group as yourself. people walk different paths\].

In part it’s none of our business, though I 100% guarantee there is more to this young man’s story and I’m sad for him and his family that this was the outcome. My brother committed suicide and so many people were completely clueless as to the actual reasons (longtime, severely detrimental family stuff that always went unrecognized and unacknowledged) for all of the actions that led up to that moment. Even my own sister. The only people who understood or who he told were maybe 3 total including myself. It’s likely Owen’s network consisted of someone who understands beyond “he was depressed”.

Hearts and hugs for everyone affected. Please talk to people about how it affects you, ask questions and go to meetups. If someone close to you committed suicide, you are considered a “suicide survivor”. You are surviving the mental and emotional upheaval and aftermath of a suicide. Do not underestimate how this can affect you. Your relationship to that person (mother, sister, friend , cousin, coworker) has no bearing on your status as a suicide survivor.

Between 2019 and 2021, there were 750 top surgeries performed on minirs - this in spite of the fact that more than 80,000 minors were diagnosed with gender dysphoria in that same time period from among 40 million patients that received healthcare in that same time period. We're talking about less than one percent of one percent of minors. Unless you're literally a doctor writing hospital policy, this is so rare as to be utterly inconsequential unless you're hung up on culture war bullshit and bigotry.


>You guys all need to re-read my posts. I am referring to the practice in general not being ""medically necessary"", _not just for minors_.

fjmebat,"this sub is one of the saltiest I've ever seen so don't sweat the down votes they're inevitable no matter what you say and even expressing some 'bad vibe reflections' should be ok imo it lends itself to conversation. I swear half the people posting have never even visited Austin for a day let alone rented or couch surfed here. thats their way of thinking they have power lol but it obviously doesn't bring them joy or fulfillment so they keep at it like it does. and if they love the city so much, even being inclined to rebut your observations, it shouldn't impact their perception of the city or their love for it, which it often from my perspective so easily does in some shape or form as people go on the extreme offensive-defense. beauty is in the eye of the beholder like anything

&amp;#x200B;

Some of your points are valid, and the city isn't encouraging loyalty by the way things are trending price wise and culturally, and cue the 'change is good / change is unavoidable' rebuttals, and forcing people to not want to stay here unless you're a google glass wearing hoverboard riding Wall-E'd out chode is not the trajectory I see myself headed on personally... but at the same time are you familiar with the place you're moving to and buying a house or you just want out of Austin? if the former could be very smart. if the latter, might be regrettable lifestyle wise and short sighted.

&amp;#x200B;

People treat North Austin or anywhere immediately outside of the bubble like its like bumfuck Texas, but it isn't... its got lots of the same shit just scattered throughout as a commuter (its not all like The Domain plastic) but definitely admittedly not as hip as downtown. I've been to Fort Worth and I found it really mellow / could live there as I get older and stop giving a shit about hip and trendy.

&amp;#x200B;

Anecdotally - I drove along Ben White Blvd the other day and was mortified by how out of control the homeless tent situation has gotten. makes the dirty 6th underpass and other parts of i35 look benign. truly depressing, and I think you can only blame open borders politicians for this bullshit. it reflects downtown too, things have gotten dirtier and shadier quick and this is my sixth year living here. I think people are also still nice on average compared to many other parts but nowhere near as overwhelmingly friendly as they used to be several years ago. I genuinely think politics has worn on people for the worse - maybe everywhere not sure - instead of wanting to improve as people and move on, they're emboldened by their shittyness because 'its crazy times and all' sigh.

&amp;#x200B;

the mid 2010's were my favorite time to be here for one reason or the other, geographical factors, personal reasons, a mix?  but my love for Austin has slowly dwindled recently even though I think there are far worse places at the same time.

Yep, kinda the point.

&gt; Also consider that the majority of firearm deaths in this country are suicides, which the CDC includes in those stats In NY we just kill ourselves via other means.

Age-adjusted suicide rate is 50% higher in Texas versus NY... 

The vast majority (believe it is 80-90%) of people that survive their first attempt at suicide, don't end up taking their own life.  For most cases, decision to commit suicide is an acute crisis, not a chronic condition.

Exercise is great for any extreme emotional state, even happiness.  True happiness must come from within.  What that means is that one cannot let external factors such as your job, bank account, house, relationship, children, car, etc be the source of happiness, because you can't control those things.  You can exercise whenever you want.  You can smile (try it right now, it feels good).  You control the food you eat, and the food you eat affects how you feel.

kbnibsi,"MrLT, I thank you for your considered and eloquent response .  Civility in these fora (Reddit, Quora, etc.) is essential for any sort of honest exploration, and I am impressed by and salute you for both your mannered presentation and lucidity.

I am a 64 year-old graduate of Occidental College here in Los Angeles.  I grew up in the Pasadena area, a beneficiary of the type of extraordinary privilege only  successful and educated parents can bestow.  Yet, despite prep school, private college, and graduate education, a shit storm of bad events and worse decisions found me homeless, destitute, depressed, and in very risky health by the end of 2019.  At 61, white-haired, blue-eyed, and vaguely pink-skinned, I was lucky enough to land in a government subsidized  program for the benefit of homeless adults with complex, chronic, and complicated medical conditions in Skid Row.  The corner of 6th and San Pedro to be precise.  For the next 16 months I found myself more or less constantly in a demographic of, well, one.  I survived, and well, by realizing the imperative that I learn to adapt to my environment as we all must.  The particular environment in which I existed, however, had challenges that few folks from my earlier life would ever face.  

I did what I was supposed to do.  Dotted i's, crossed t's, filled out the forms, delivered them on time, arrived early for obligations, and kept out of the nonsense that surrounded me.  I also embraced my own reality: this is where I live, and I had to choose where and how I lived it.  My story is long, peppered with experiences mundane and extraordinary, and populated by acquaintances often crass and sometimes ethereal.  I regained my health while living on the Row.  I made friends and navigated threats. I avoided the bad decisions many embraced as their destinies.  When most guys I knew wasted their stimulus checks on dope, booze, sex, tacky bling, or electronics they couldn't operate, I bought slacks and sport coats, books, and fresh fruit.  I stood my ground when tested, but relied on that inner voice when serious danger threatened.  And after 2 1/2 years (the last bit spent in the luxurious environs near 18th and Union), I moved out.

I received help.  I will remain eternally grateful, because I damn sure needed it.  But for me, the ""system"" - with much negotiation and occasional prodding - worked.  Which sadly makes me an anomaly.  Despite the billions of dollars lately thrown at the problem of homelessness, very few actually succeed.  I have opinions about why the system fails so profoundly, but those thoughts must wait til another time. 

I offer you this brief glimpse of the last few years not in hopes of gaining sympathy or any other similar crap, but simply to establish my bona fides.  I hope we can incorporate some of my thinking as we continue this good conversation.

BTW: Even today, when I return to the Row to maintain my connections with friends who haven't gotten it together quite yet, usually to subsidize a lunch and shopping spree at the local 99¢ Store down on Washington, I still am subject to shoutouts.

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/data-do-not-back-cloth-masks-limit-covid-19-experts-say

&gt;Limited, indirect evidence from lab studies suggests that homemade fabric masks may capture large respiratory droplets, but there is no evidence they impede the transmission of aerosols implicated in the spread of COVID-19, according to a paper published yesterday by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

&gt;In the paper, the National Academies' Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats said that, because no studies have been done on the effectiveness of cloth masks in preventing transmission of coronavirus to others, it is impossible to assess their benefits, if any.

&gt;The paper was prepared by committee members Richard Besser, MD, of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Baruch Fischhoff, PhD, of Carnegie Mellon University, and two subject matter experts contributed. It was approved by Committee Chair Harvey Fineberg, MD, PhD, and was peer-reviewed by seven additional US experts.

1.         Wherever possible there must be independent confirmation of the “facts.”
1.         Encourage substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgeable proponents of all points of view.
1.         **Arguments from authority carry little weight — “authorities” have made mistakes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Perhaps a better way to say it is that in science there are no authorities; at most, there are experts.**
1.         Spin more than one hypothesis. If there’s something to be explained, think of all the different ways in which it could be explained. Then think of tests by which you might systematically disprove each of the alternatives. What survives, the hypothesis that resists disproof in this Darwinian selection among “multiple working hypotheses,” has a much better chance of being the right answer than if you had simply run with the first idea that caught your fancy.
1.         Try not to get overly attached to a hypothesis just because it’s yours. It’s only a way station in the pursuit of knowledge. Ask yourself why you like the idea. Compare it fairly with the alternatives. See if you can find reasons for rejecting it. If you don’t, others will.
1.         Quantify. If whatever it is you’re explaining has some measure, some numerical quantity attached to it, you’ll be much better able to discriminate among competing hypotheses. What is vague and qualitative is open to many explanations. Of course there are truths to be sought in the many qualitative issues we are obliged to confront, but finding them is more challenging.
1.         If there’s a chain of argument, every link in the chain must work (including the premise) — not just most of them.
1.         Occam’s Razor. This convenient rule-of-thumb urges us when faced with two hypotheses that explain the data equally well to choose the simpler.
1.         Always ask whether the hypothesis can be, at least in principle, falsified. **Propositions that are untestable, unfalsifiable are not worth much.** Consider the grand idea that our Universe and everything in it is just an elementary particle — an electron, say — in a much bigger Cosmos. But if we can never acquire information from outside our Universe, is not the idea incapable of disproof? You must be able to check assertions out. Inveterate skeptics must be given the chance to follow your reasoning, to duplicate your experiments and see if they get the same result.",comment,Houston,1.0

As of this moment the most simple and cost effective measure to stop the operation of all the non preico dispensaries is to either 1) call in the Feds 2) issue $1,000 daily penalties (which Feuer could do but hasn't!!!!)

So let's be clear mike Feuer convinces you that this investigation is the reasoning for why it is taking so long to shutdown pot shops.... So let's ignore the fact that he can make it immediately unprofitable for all the illegal pot shops with fines that he has no problem enforcing .... Except he enforces the fines on no one ....


If mike Feuer made u believe that an investigation is what is stopping prop d ordinance enforcement ( and u want it enforced) then u go on and keep believing that!


Open your eyes or drive around LA after 8 pm when the city tells everyone to close... Notice how u still see open signs on and no police stopping them


Yes u keep believing what u read and not what u see going on in LA !

That’s weird because all you said was play Grant instead of White. 

Are you suggesting playing 3 bigs? 

You’re not abandoning Grant for White, because they don’t play the same position.

Playing 3 bigs agains the warriors is suicide.

Steph Curry is the greatest shooter of all time at the peak of his powers. He’s going to score. While the mistakes are ugly when they happen he’s hitting a ton of his threes contested. He’s just really ducking good at scoring the ball.

White’s been defending him well, he’s one of the only guys on the team who can run with him.

The defense has not been a problem. We haven’t allowed more than 108 points in the series. That is excellent. 

Curry scoring 30+ and the warriors barely cracking 100 points is a recipe for success.

Quite frankly, that's likely what is making the drug &amp; death problem worse.

I hope they consider taking a similar route as they are with weed -- just allowing or even encouraging smoke shops/pharmacies to sell the product and having city officials look the other way. While it isn't a perfect solution, at least it would make it more available.

People die so, so quickly and violently from fentanyl and it's often people who are vulnerable, already in pain, and have already been failed by the system in so many ways. It's literally the least that can be done to help people who've fallen through so many cracks in our system.

gkyz58m," as per the OG article linked above there *were* internet searches for committing suicide - personally though I don't put a lot of stock in that since the fiance is the (presumed most likely) suspect and would have had access to her Google search anyway. All it takes is a couple seconds on an open computer and pretending you're looking up the weather or something.

She also had several text exchanges with her mom that indicated pretty severe depression in the months before - ""I know u don’t understand but **I can’t keep living with feeling this way,**"" (written before starting the news meds) and as far as I've seen no one has debated the veracity of those texts. 

""*if she did indeed attempt to sever her own spinal cord in order to reduce the pain of stabs, how did she know to do that?""* Oh, I agree. I think it would've had to have been a completely accidental outcome that, if it did happen, facilitated it being a successful attempt.

Crime overall is down, but what's really depressing is [this comparison on the changes in crime in terms of area of the city](http://www.urbanophile.com/2013/08/12/the-growing-public-safety-inequality-gap-in-chicago-by-daniel-hertz/).

A quote from the piece on [this map](http://danielhertz.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/murderchange1.png) in particular (emphasis mine):

""The areas in darkest green saw the greatest decline; **red means the murder rate actually increased.**

So: Yes, the great Crime Decline is a fickle thing. The North Side saw huge decreases (in Rogers Park, it was over 80%) pretty much everywhere; the few areas that are lighter green were the safest in the city to begin with. The parts of the South and West Sides closest to downtown  Bronzeville, the West Loop, Pilsen, etc.  got a lot safer. But most of the rest actually got worse, including some neighborhoods that were already among the most dangerous in the city, like Englewood and Garfield Park.

This is a complicated state of affairs, and probably goes at least part of the way to explaining why, **in the face of a 50% decrease in homicides citywide over the last two decades, many people persist in believing that the opposite is true: because in their neighborhoods, it is.**""

And then there's [this map](http://danielhertz.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/homicideratio2.png), explained here (again, emphasis mine):

""Over the last twenty years, at the same time as overall crime has declined, **the inequality of violence in Chicago has skyrocketed.** The pattern of whats blue and whats red in each map is mostly the same; I count only three out of twenty-five districts that switched from one color to another. But **the colors are much darker in the 2000s than they were in the 1990s.** There have always been safer and more dangerous areas here, as there are everywhere; but the gap between them is way, way bigger **meow** than it used to be.""

The myth is that we're cleaning up the city. We're only gentrifying specific areas and making others worse.

e9gqm16,"Let's address this data you have supplied. Your first study states that where there are more guns, there are more accidental GUN deaths. Not accidental deaths overall, not deaths overall. It could very well be that gun related deaths decreased, but overall death was unaffected and violent crime increased or remained the same (This was the case in Australia after their nationwide gun ban, as well as our nation during the assault weapons ban. This is typically true of stricter gun control states as well) Their results are based on only the top four and bottom four states, and does not statistically check to see if these are outliers or if that correlation follows a median. They also did not adjust for socioeconomic factors or demographic factors. Other issues that plague this study: Only looks at 1 year of data. Uses data from a telephone response data gathering system that does not adjust for different states participation rates or willingness to answer truthfully. Telephone data gathering system relies on self reporting, leading participants in states that have stricter gun laws having a direct incentive to lie. Research paper does not provide data analysis, cannot fact check the work that lead to their opinion of results. Results are presented misleadingly, suggesting a strong research bias. For these reasons, this research is ineffective and proves nothing other than maybe a weak correlation.  

Second study is an aggregate of other studies compiled together and translated to its conclusion. This one is a dozy. First off, the study provides a red flag just in the abstract: ""Limitations:
Firearm accessibility was determined by survey interviews in most studies; misclassification of accessibility may have occurred. Heterogeneous populations of varying risks were synthesized to estimate pooled odds of death."" This states that the data was 1) unreliable and 2) synthesized. More red flags present further along.  ""Results from ecological studies suggest that state restrictions on firearm ownership are associated with decreases in firearm-related suicides and homicides (5)."" Again, this study only looks at firearm related deaths, not deaths as a whole. ""The database searches yielded 6902 references (Figure 1). We removed 2929 duplicates and an additional 2881 clearly irrelevant references. We then identified 2382 records through gray-literature searches. We closely reviewed 3474 titles and abstracts. After this screening, we selected 70 articles for full-text review. We identified an additional 4 studies by cross-referencing bibliographies (16–19). Overall, 16 observational studies met our inclusion criteria."" This SCREAMS cherry picked data.

Study 3 actually agrees with me! First page: ""Although these studies are useful in
demonstrating an association between access to firearms and
rates of homicide and suicide at the aggregate level, it is not
possible with this methodology to adequately assess whether
access to a gun increases the risk of a violent death at the
individual level."" 

At the base level I want what you want, which is a less violent society in which violent crime, suicide, and homicide all go down. The difference is I believe that guns are just a tool, and it is people that perpetrate violence. You may take the tool away, but you are not treating the cause. This belief is supported by history and data from other countries that have enacted strict gun control. You believe that it is the tool that is causing the violence and believe that it is okay to restrict the rights of citizens based on that belief. 

Edit: To address your hypothetical. I am a skeptic at heart and analyze any research that I may find. 95% of gun control studies supporting gun control only factor gun related deaths, not deaths in the aggregate or do not control for variables or discuss if other actions could have the same impact without restricting the rights of citizens. The only research I have found that has aggregated total deaths is that safe gun storage practices reduces overall teen and child death. This data has changed my view of safe storage laws as well as changed my view of how I store my own firearms since I have a young son. ",comment,Portland,1.0

I'm from Chicago, the constant punching bag for gun control, and although handguns were illegal for a long time it was just remarkably easy for gang bangers to go buy hand guns in other states with lax laws.

That day really hardened me to not trusting people.

Reported it to Animal Control and also called Austin Public Health re: rabies.

Ended up with Teatnus, Rabavert (vaccine) and RIg.  The Dr said he wouldn’t get a rabies shot of he was in my shoes, Austin Public Health said why not, although they did state there hasn’t been a confirmed case of rabies in a dog in Travis County in the past 25 years.  If there was a rabid dog, it would be all over the news.   Also the last stage of rabies for a dog is a small window.

After the first shot I had some wild neurological symptoms and reactive arthritis in my lower back for 6 months.  I read that one of the listed potential “side effects” of Rabavert is a temporal relation to Multiple Sclerosis.

The only reason I mention this is to discuss things with APH and your Dr and decide for yourself.

hnhej66,"Bold of you to assume I did nothing and creepy that you had to comb my comment history specifically to use it against me as if I could hurt any worse that I already do. Make sure you rub it in good though so you can really taste the pain. Can you feel my tears yet? How satisfying is it for you to know that I can't sleep anymore because my brain goes through endless scenarios looking for a different outcome, and that I'm having panic attacks, and constantly feel like I want to throw up because I can't stop imagining my dad swinging lifelessly because of my own actions that I had to take to protect my son. I don't even get the benefit of viewing his body because it's too damaged. Every day I bounce between blaming myself and telling myself I had to protect my son. The pain is choking me. Does it feel good for you? Did you get hard knowing you saved a buck while shitting on me?

  
I wrote that post you quoted when I was falling apart and dealing with realizing my own abuse from him and my failure at protecting my son from the shit I went through. My son has panic attacks now and breaks down when ever his younger sister starts talking about him. He was an asshole narc about half the time. But he was also my father and he also had really good parts to him. If he didn't have any good, we never would have tried to keep him in our lives for so long and I never would have taken him into my home. We never would have held out hope that might have changed and gotten help. We knew his narc personality was directly from his horrific abuse as a child and we hoped our love might be enough to change him. We were also victims of abuse that were still in the fog, if you are familiar with that term. We had a lifetime of fear and conditioning that we couldn't escape without help. We weren't even aware of how bad it all was until recently because we had to figure this shit out all on our own. We used to think we all turned out pretty ok all things considered. Now we're all unraveling and falling apart and discovering how deep the damage really goes. I can feel you smiling at the thought of me getting what I deserve.   


I'll paste the response I gave to someone else that tried to blame me for my father's death by claiming I did nothing. You lunatics wouldn't be happy unless I completely destroyed myself and my family and let my son kill himself just so you didn't have to pay a nickel. But I did my part. I held on as long as I could and sacrificed things I never should have had to sacrifice because people like you think it not your problem, so there was no where for me to turn to anyway. Your anti-human stance of ""Not My Problem"" seems to be working out great for you guys though. You can't use your parks and crime has gone through the roof and people are hanging themselves in public spaces to be found by hikers. Ironic how it still ends up being your problem, and it's 100 times worse and costs so much more than just contributing to stronger social services. At this point you might as well just admit you want them rounded up and gassed so you don't have to look at them.

\------------------------

I did \[take care of him\]. I was the only one willing to after he alienated everyone else. I housed, clothed, and fed him for 2 years. He ended up driving my 9 YEAR OLD to thoughts of SUICIDE with his behavior, as well as putting me on the verge of a mental breakdown for just trying to do the right thing and not abandon him to a system that couldn't help him. His extreme childhood abuse saddled him with a personality disorder that makes him believe that there is nothing wrong with him at all (because to believe otherwise means having to face something so absolutely horrific that his brain walled off in self-preservation a long time ago), and that everyone else was out to get him and he had no idea how to love people without hurting them. So because he didn't believe anything was wrong with him, he rage quit the family and left. And we all knew it would come to this when we finally stood up to him and demand he get help, we just weren't sure if he'd try to take my mom with him, so we had to keep him away for everyone's protection. We contacted the VA and local outreach programs but they couldn't do a damn thing because he wouldn't do it voluntarily and they couldn't hold him against his will because he wasn't obviously psychotic and there's no money or programs to do it anyway anymore. Housing is so underfunded he'd be waiting months and the shelters were overflowing and filled with covid outbreaks, so he set up a camp in the woods and strung himself up at the age of 63 to get back at me for protecting my son from the cycle of abuse that follows this family like a ghoul. So he showed me instead. It's my fucking fault that my father is dead because I didn't have the tits to tell my son to suck it up for grandpa and that we live in a shithole dystopia that says fuck you, you're on your own and if you can't undo massive mental barriers trying to protect you from the horrors of your childhood all on your own, well fuck you buddy, it's your your own damn fault. You can't contribute to society so hanging from a tree to feed the birds is about as valuable as you'll ever be to this piss stain of a country only concerned with housing values and keeping the riff raff out of the genteel spaces of the dignified folks that just want to walk to to church without tripping over another piece of shit vagabond. Heaven forbid we actually act like a fucking society that gives a shit about the quality of our people and do things that actually work. Instead we get bullied into bullshit compromises by so-called fiscally conservative snakes that appear to save money by gutting programs, but actually wastes it because the programs aren't fixing anything. Then they get to point at it and say ""See, it doesn't work"" and cut the programs even more the next time around because apparently people are vermin that lose motivation to make that almighty buck if shown an ounce of compassion. And that's just the tip of the iceberg of this dysfunctional nightmare of a country that thinks rugged individualism is a virtue and that only suckers give a shit about anyone else.

But yeah, fuck these people. Tee-hee. Let's burn their shit. Not like anyone is going to miss them and my personal time at the park is definitely more important when looking at the big picture. Fucking nerve they have daring to remind people that there is no real help for truly damaged. They aren't people anyway, right. They chose this shit.

ffw17qm,"I think that if the US had the same number of firearms as say Finland, the suicide and violent crime rate would still be higher.

A primary contributing factor I believe is a general culture of violence being seen as a valid solution to problems, as well as a growing wealth gap (and worse, the increased awareness and perception of this gap). Furthermore, where else in the world can someone get anxiety over whether they can afford to go to the doctor? Apologizes for the anecdote, but I've spoken to multiple people who say they don't get a checkup because ""if it's something serious, we're (family) ruined.""

I'll freely acknowledge that firearms are problematic when it comes to people who are suicidal.

1dvef84,"Recs for an empathetic doctor in ATX?  Hi all - not sure where else to post this so I thought I’d try here. I’m trying to get my physical health back on track, but I’m having a ROUGH time mentally. Specifically, I have a ton of anxiety around medical issues and have hit a point with my depression that it is affecting my ability to function.

My doctor is ok, but mostly seems annoyed at me for being stressed out. I leave appointments feeling chastised and embarrassed for my physical and mental health. It’s frustrating because it takes everything I’ve got to get myself to the point where I’m going to the doctor and trying to better myself. 

Everyone says if you’re struggling, “get help.” I’m at the doctor because I need some guidance and help.  And when I get there I’m just criticized for my issues and left with a list of things wrong with me and what I’m at risk for. I want to focus on developing healthier habits and taking control of my mental and physical health, not just testing for things wrong with me and treating them with medication.

Does anyone have a recommendation for a primary care doctor in Austin who is empathetic and will work with patients to improve their physical health while they are also experiencing mental health issues? Maybe someone who practices Western medicine but also incorporates some traditional medicine and health care techniques to treat the whole person? Some sort of group work? Something less traditional? Maybe a good, open-minded psychiatrist while I’m at it?

I have a therapist. I’m exercising more and eating better. I’m taking blood pressure meds.
I understand that I need to take responsibility for myself, but after years of trying to just tough it out and pull myself together, I’m realizing I need some extensive help. I just need more help. I’m lost and suffering, and I want to get better, for my family’s sake.

Please go easy on me. I know I should be tougher and stop complaining. Any criticisms you have of me are probably valid and I’ve been beating myself up for decades. It isn’t working and I need to try something else.
Thanks.

dj8x1u5,"For what it's worth, by 1973 a lot of people were already suggesting this had been a gigantic mistake.  Reason being there we were fully committed all-in on interstate highways ... and here came the Arab Oil Embargo / OPEC / gas prices quadrupling in the span of a few months.  American auto makers - up until then catering to the big car and muscle car buyer - and having not had the benefit of a total reboot in the 1940s and 1950s - got caught blindsided.  All of a sudden all those funny little Japanese and Italian and German cars were in demand, while the Big Four (soon to be the Big Three) were only able to build Big Detroit cars.  All suffered significant drops in sales, and the Rust Belt was born.


A big part of why urban cores now are scrambling to find enough housing is partly a result of the 40-50 year period where downtown cores were considered undesirable to live in by a majority of Americans, all of whom were all-in on the suburbs.  Lower taxes, subsidized roadways, subsidized auto industry, subsidized fuel.  It all combines to form a significant part of America's economic wealth, 1950s to 1990s at least.

And then those depressed cities and abandoned warehouses make ... hipster magnets.  And we started re-animating the cities into what you all want a huge piece of today.  by the 2000s it's no secret every big city in America is a flippin arts scene, gay culture scene, student and upwardly mobile young person scene, and tech startup scene.  But those 100 year old buildings weren't going to last, not with all that money now streaming in.


So now what.  Many want to get rid of the car, but without a national system of high speed rail, that's a really unrealistic proposal outside of denser urban core areas.  There's also what I consider the greatest legacy of suburban subsidized life - the street ~~grids~~ layout of all that suburban land - not a grid system mostly any more, but rather now non-walkable cul-de-sac and isolated developments.  Because to this day, we *still* aren't building suburbs to a walkable grid, we're building them only being connectable to by cars.  Even when a planned walkable downtown happens, like Issaquah Highlands, it still must be driven towards, and once you're there you are required to own a car to leave.

Walkable grids ... cities require them, but we aren't building any new ones.  That leads to the massive bidding war we have going now for our existing legacy urban core areas, the ones built pre 1945 suburban sprawl, and the big cutover from sharing transit (street cars, buses, walking, bikes) to owning your own transit (1945 - 1990 and beyond to this day)


Will self-driving cars help?  Not really for this.  They'll mean more people can use personal or leased car services to commute, they *won't* mean more people live in car-free areas.  Our potential car-free city grids are all being sold to the highest bidder right now.  Their era of being affordable middle class housing is passing rapidly into history as we speak; we have daily arguments over whether they should be even more dense.  I'd argue it won't matter, the demand is far outpacing the supply -- but the issue is not the building stock in the city grid, it's the city grid itself.  Every pre-world-war-2 city grid of any size in America right now is undergoing some kind of renaissance.  Some got started in the 1970s and 1980s (San Francisco, NY) and a whole shitload of those got started in the 1990s including Seattle, and now you have to pretty much pick an otherwise ""undesirable"" urban core someplace to find one that still meets the definition of ""affordable.""

So, urban planners.  I humbly submit to you. It isn't density because of buildings, it's density because of the road grid.  We're rapidly running out of it.  We have bidding wars going on for every dense urban core in America right now.  As these grids get re-developed with shiny new towers, affordability gets shoved further and further out to the suburbs where --- a personal transport vehicle is required for daily life and survival.

What are you guys' going to do about that?  Keep advocating for more shiny towers downtown?  I don't really think that will solve affordability long term.  We're already seeing every major downtown core that's now a generation or more in demand being bid up and out of affordable status by investment money and business demand.  Where are the middle class people supposed to live?  Please don't say we tear down every SFH and put up 10 story apartments.  Thats only going to delay the inevitable a while further.  What that winds up doing is creating more megalopolises - but it also winds up creating more demand for sprawl around them.

What do we do to get rid of sprawl?  The existing suburban road grid -- which is being added to even to this day -- does not help build density and does not help build affordability long term.  It won't sustain.  What do we do about it?",comment,Seattle,1.0

Perhaps I used the wrong word. I'm not referring to the natural mental issue of depression. I'm talking about the harm you're causing someone by telling them the institution they're being raised in is personally against them for something they naturally feel and doesn't harm anyone.

&gt; Do any of you expect these kids to not know what they're doing is bad? Jumping with full body weight on someone, punching, kicking? 10 vs 1? Do we expect these kids to be ""reformed"" with better funded schools? Is the problem with school funding and ""institutional racism"" or is it familial upbringing? I can't imagine ever raising a child to do this to another person 

Of course they know what they're doing. No one is arguing that they don't know what they're doing. This is group mentality at it's finest. In terms of reform, you're implying that this is now something innate that they will pursue for years to come. Now, with the argument of familial upbringing. 

My ass grew up in this type of area. Anger and depression are at an all time high. The parents are shit and just want to get through the day. The kids grow up and shit and act out because they don't know what's wrong. Why is mom always mad or depressed? Why is dad the same way or just not there all together? Why do I feel this way? Why can't I just scream and get these bad emotions out of me? WTF DO I DO?

Do we think these kids can excel in school if they can't even behave like a civilized person? They're gonna end up in jails when they're out of school. We should be outraged at this. We should not chalk it up to ""the system"" and look inward to see how we can better raise our youth. And it's not with more money for schools or affirmative action. You throw these kids into Brown they're gonna be miserable.

I'll answer 3 and 4 together because they're basically the same shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now...black and latino men make up the majority of the US prison population. As several studies have shown...if you want to take them seriously, the lack of strong male parent/role model figures is part of a huge correlation between the probability of depression or the rate of crime that a male child faces. Cool.

Riddle me this: we already have the highest percentage of black and latino men in prison. Meaning these males have no guidance. As Tupac said ""It ain't easy for a woman to try to raise a man."" I can quote shit to btw.

Now, the lack of males will lead to an increase in crime and the cycle will keep going and going and going...

cool...

using that logic...what can break the cycle? 

People have theorized that financially elevating some of these people out of poverty will lead to a decrease in a generation's black and latino male population from possibly committing crime. Cool...so how do we get them out of poverty without just giving them straight up money?

Education...

But these motherfuckers statistically won't make it into college...but then how do you break the cycle? .. what if, and I need you to follow me on this one...what if we make it easier for that demographic specifically, to reach college? Even if the odds of them graduating is way low...there will be some that make it. And with that...they will have avenues of financial revenue that they wouldn't have had previously...thus..hopefully..over time...decreasing the probability of the specific generation's population from falling into the aforementioned cycle...

&amp;#x200B;

Not only that...but an exposure to the college culture will hopefully expose these kids to a culture MUCH different than they grew up in. It gives them something many people that didn't grow up in that situation take for granted...it gives them hope. Even if they fail out, the time spent AWAY from that environment can HOPEFULLY allow them to change their perception of the world. And hopefully, it will allow them to try to pursue a similar setting even after failing out. Thus, again, hopefully, leading to the desired decrease in criminal activity yada yada yada blah

Winning or lack thereof is not really the biggest concern. So it’s not about entitlement- it’s about the lack of passing, the shitty body language, the energetic malaise, the losing to teams we should beat over and over again. Going down 15-20 almost every first half. The lack of fight or any kind of team offense. 
It’s irrelevant if it’s actually true or not that this is objectively, quantifiable, the most depressing season ever- it’s that it feels like that to a guy who’s watched the Celtics since the days of Russell and Cousy, every year through thick and thin, and never said anything like that until the 18-19 season, and then feels like this year has actually worse, despite being a super happy old guy who’s not obsessed with his team winning or making deep playoff runs but simply wants to watch some Celtics pride and team play.",comment,Boston,1.0

Well, prison guards have a notoriously high suicide and washout rate. Also, prisons are having staffing problems all over the country because it's such a shitty job... So I don't see how you can say they're paying too much when they're already unable to retain and recruit.

kf0boyl,"His name was Ben Moulah. He was a giant of a little man. A beautiful soul and one of my greatest friends. He struggled for so many years. My husband and I talked to him on the phone many times when he was on the edge years ago. Then, the unthinkable. My husband lost his life to suicide. Ben was amazing. He showed up at my door with his two teen daughters, flowers, candy and the biggest teddy bear I had ever seen in case I needed hugs when Ben and his daughters were not around to give them to me. He was one of the reasons I got through it all. He loved my husband as a brother and Mikes suicide really affected Ben. Mike and Ben talked about their struggles together quite a bit and very openly in order to keep one another going. Ben hurt so very much after Mikes death, but he was always so very strong for me. 
Ben was a single father that raised 2 beautiful wonderful daughters. He was also a full time caretaker to his frail and elderly father. All at the same time while busting his ass in tough physical jobs in order to keep things together. I don't know how he did it all, but he did. It wasn't always graceful or pretty because Ben struggled with his own mental health issues and alcoholism. But his daughters character and successes are a testament to his success while wearing all of those hats. After his girls grew up and started their own lives and his father passed, Ben floundered to find his purpose and struggled with homelessness and alcoholism. I had moved to the very Southern end of the state to start my life anew and did not check in with Ben as often as I should have. I guess it's how life goes, you get busy with new jobs, relationships, homes. Cell phones get lost, phone numbers change, and so on. Next thing you know, a few or more years have passed and you assume all is well with your friends you haven't heard from for awhile. It's how life works.
After going through everything with my husband, I know for certain that I was only doing what I had to do to survive my own struggles and demons but I will forever wonder if things would have been different had I been checking in.
I looked at his Facebook and the only posts over the last 3-4 years were me wishing him happy birthday each year. He was my birthday buddy and exactly one week older. I really hope he had other friends in touch that checked in with him. If I had known he was homeless at any point, I would have driven the 5 hours and swooped him up and brought him home with me and helped him any way I could. It's a lesson to me. He was there for me in my darkest times and I walked away. He was one of my best friends and my little bigger brother. While I know this is not my fault, I do know that my intervention would have had those two girls with a dad still. Let this be a lesson to all....please please please. If you know anyone at all who struggles, don't walk away. Yes, live your life, but NEVER forget what you leave behind. It takes so little time or effort just to make that call say ""How are you doing?"" You could save a person's life. Love one another, be kind, patient, understanding, and never ever ever let someone walk away from you without telling them what they mean to you....RIP Benny Ben Ben, you crazy little shit.

c7nvm13,"YES! I have found the most perfect date night restaurant in LA. It's a small, unassuming french restaurant in Eagle Rock called [Cafe Beaujolais](http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-beaujolais-los-angeles). This place is the best way to experience what a French restaurant is really like without travelling on a plane for 12 hours; I feel like I'm transported to a cafe in France when I'm there. All the staff is French, so be prepared for the most insanely precise and detailed service in your life. It's like this place is trying to make up for how rude other restaurants in LA are. Through their actions you sense a kind of pride that doesn't appear in other restaurant staff. As soon as your water glass drops below full, they are there filling it up for you. I know sometimes this can be annoying, but done with the grace of a Frenchman I enjoy it; they all take their job very seriously. Which doesn't mean they won't joke around at your table, it's just not a priority. If you want it to be a fun night, they go along with that, if you want it to be a serious night, they'll treat you like you're Bruce Wayne. (little side note, we ended up getting friendly with our waiter the first time there and they gave us both a free glass of cognac at the end of the night! It was also our wedding anniversary, though, so it was a special night)

Finally, the food. If you're a steak person DO NOT miss the Filet Mignon. Jesus holy Christ is it amazing. My mouth is watering now just thinking about it. But make sure you or your date also orders the Halibut. Now, let me take a second to stress this. I am not a fish person. I'll eat shrimp, but fish, any fish, I pass on 9 times out of 10. Except at Cafe Beaujolais. Again, Holy Jesus. I never knew fish could taste like heaven, but they did it here. It's lemony and light and fluffy, like a cloud of heaven that melts on your tongue. I could taste absolutely no remnant of fish, it was just a soft piece of delicious buttery flavor dancing on my tongue. It's witchcraft in the form of food! Nothing has ever or will ever be so delicious!

I won't take up too much more of your time, but I'll leave you with this little cherry on top if I haven't convinced you yet: You will get laid if you take a woman to Cafe Beaujolais. That's just a goddamn fact. 

And p.s. I LOVE that view from the 2 freeway, it's my favorite of LA, too! And if you want to do outdoorsy stuff I would say get out of LA, unless it's after a rainy day, because, as I'm sure you know, most views on normal smoggy days are just a little depressing. I recommend a day trip to the beach in San Clemente with a walk on the CLEAN beach (unlike anywhere in LA) and a clam chowder lunch on the pier (BEST clam chowder in a sourdough bowl is at the Fisherman's restaurant on the pier, sit outside and you can watch the waves underneath your feet. And YES it's better than Disneyland!). Or a camping trip out to Joshua tree is always fun (in the warmer months)! I always find true relaxation lies just outside the big city limits.

lm4mjgo,"Went from a 15 min commute to a 90 min commute (mostly train, some walking) at the end of 2019. Here’s my experience in stream of consciousness order:

1. Tons of time to watch Netflix. Caught up on everything and ran out of stuff to watch in two months.

2. Holy heck it’s cold in winter (this was in Chicago to be fair) and any day snow was on the table involved waking up at like 4am in case I needed to shovel out my car to get to the train.

3. Adding +/- 3 hours to a 9 hour work day is rough. If you get 8hrs of sleep, that leaves 4 hours for you to be a human. Kiss your hobbies and friends goodbye because even if you had the time, you probably don’t have the energy left over. 

4. Days are long, depression is real. My job was amazing and I felt so good at it every minute of the workday. My work had real world meaning and made people’s lives better. I still could hardly motivate myself on a Monday or Thursday… Getting home around 7pm every day because of the commute really took it out of me.

5. When covid hit, I went remote. Having that extra time back made me feel so energized that I picked up guitar. It’s been not even five years and I’ve been playing shows and releasing music and really feel like there’s a meaning to my life for the first time since college. I’ll never give it up again because it’s the most rewarding thing I’ve ever done. Don’t tell my wife…

6. There are good days and bad days on the train. Sometimes there’s a 45 minute delay. Sometimes you don’t get a seat and have to stand for 90 minutes. Sometimes there’s a delay and you have to stand for 2 hours before your work day has even started.

7. My boss kept pressuring me to accept a hotspot so I could work on the train. Another 3 hours / day unpaid..  

8. Depending on the job, you might actually really suffer for getting caught on the train. There were a few IT outages that struck while I was en route and I (acting director of IT) could not be involved outside of brief phone calls made cramped between strangers. For better or worse…

If I really needed the money (crippling debt, going to lose my house, etc), then maybe, probably even… but if I can sustain my current lifestyle without it, you won’t catch me dead with an hour+ commute ever again!",comment,Boston,1.0

69udad,"Is anyone here a huge Sigur Rós fan and want to go see them May 23 at Fox Theater with me? So here's the thing. 

Eleven years ago I discovered Sigur Rós from an issue of AP magazine and my life hasn't been the same since. I know it's annoying when people say something so basic like that but I truly, unequivocally mean it. They are my favorite band in the entire world, but it's more than that. 

Eleven years is a long time to experience things and I've been through just about everything during that time, and Sigur Rós was there for every struggle and victory. Their music was there every time I got my heartbroken, which has been a lot. They were there the times my heart was happy and the music made everything in the world so much more beautiful. They were there when I was so lonely I didn't think I could make it through another day and they were there when I was surrounded by new friends. They were there to help me feel strong again after failed suicide attempts and to make the times I felt elated and alive feel more incandescent. They influenced me to travel to Iceland (though I had wanted to go there way before), where my life, and who I am as a person, was forever changed for the better. 

Their music has absolutely been the soundtrack of my life, which I know is another annoying basic thing to say but it's the best way to put it. I think a lot of people have a band like that. 

For eleven years I have tried to go to a Sigur Rós concert and it has never worked out. Tickets were sold out, I didn't have money for tickets or to travel to a show, they didn't tour near me, or weren't touring at all, or some other reason. It's been on my bucket list for so long (one of my top things is to see them at Harpa in Reykjavik but that can wait) and now finally I live in a city they are coming to and can afford tickets and I'm unbelievably excited. I even researched what the best seats at the Fox were and bought them, because this is like a major event in my life. 

The reason I'm saying all this is because none of my friends, at least the ones that live near or would be willing to come here, like Sigur Rós. I've taken people to concerts before who didn't care about the band and it sucks, they're just bored and it kinda drags you down. Since this is my favorite band and something I've been waiting so long to do I just can't imagine taking someone who's not a fan. If I take one of my friends they'd just be texting the whole time while I'm sitting there crying because of how brilliant Jónsi is. I want to be able to discuss how amazing the show was with someone and hopefully have it mean something to them. 

So that's why I'm here, I'm hoping to find someone in Atlanta, or anywhere if they want to come to Atlanta, who loves Sigur Rós. They don't have to be your absolute favorite but at least a band you really enjoy. You can have my extra ticket. Just message me and if that goes well I'll give you my social media so you can see I'm normal and awesome and all that stuff (and I can see you are too). 

If there's another sub I can post this to please suggest it. 

I just need to have a good time at this concert you guys. ",submission,Atlanta,1.0

**MASS SHOOTING CASUALTIES IN THE U.S. IN 2018**

* **426 verified mass shootings**

* **528 people killed**

* **1,549 people wounded**

* **2,077 total casualties (killed &amp; wounded)**

The figures above only represent victims of [mass shootings](http://www.massshootingtracker.org/about#massshooting) (when four or more people were shot in an event, or related series of events without a cooling off period). Not included are victims of shootings where three or fewer people were shot. For more information, check out GrC's [**Mass Shooting Tracker**](https://www.massshootingtracker.org/data/2018).

**Bonus Mass Shooting Fun Facts for 2018:**

* There was an average of **1.17 mass shootings per day** in 2018.

* The **top 10 states for mass shootings** in 2018 (# per million people) were: **Alabama** (3.48), **Tennessee** (3.39), **Illinois** (3.21), **Missouri** (3.10), **Louisiana** (2.78),  **Oklahoma** (2.28), **Arkansas** (1.98), **Nevada** (1.96), **Colorado** (1.76), **Florida** (1.69).

* Of the 426 mass shootings in 2018, **158 (37%) involved domestic violence or juvenile casualties**. 


&amp;nbsp;

**DOMESTIC, ACCIDENTAL &amp; SUICIDE SHOOTINGS IN THE U.S. IN 2018**

Of course, mass shootings account for only a small fraction of the total number of shootings that occur every day, many of which involve domestic violence, accidents, suicides, children, and a *much* smaller number of justified ""defensive gun uses"" (DGUs).  On average, **96 Americans are killed and 246 injured with guns every day** [[source]](http://www.bradycampaign.org/key-gun-violence-statistics), resulting in approximately **10,403 gunshot casualties each month.** In the U.S. between 2012 and 2017 – the last year for which CDC data is available – ***1 of every 75 deaths in the U.S. was caused by gunshot*** [[sources]](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/wiki/year_by_year_figures).

**DEFENSIVE GUN USES (DGUs) IN THE U.S. IN 2018**

By comparison, in 2018 there were **1,443 apparently justified DGUs in the U.S.** where armed civilian gun owners attempted to prevent crimes (including incidents where no shots were fired), as presented in the table below (the figures below do not include incidents where unarmed citizens successfully defended themselves against armed criminals, incidents where armed law enforcement officers defended themselves, or [""bad DGUs""](https://old.reddit.com/r/bad_dgu/)):

The figures above indicate that in 2018, ***incidents where Americans shot themselves, a family member, an intimate partner or an innocent bystander (unintentionally) were 23 times more common than incidents where Americans used a gun in a justified attempt to stop a crime (see [**chart**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQUiF2_xuhkq2soBopINRfvBcJQF8ff0KQkklvVa134POfwszcfPUjpH6wCNFtN46r3gf_nqpnIdNjc/pubchart?oid=208007580&amp;format=interactive)).*** This includes reported DGU incidents where Americans used guns to prevent petty larceny.  Even if gun suicides are excluded, Americans were still 3.3 times more likely to shoot themselves, a family member, an intimate partner or an innocent bystander (unintentionally) than to use a gun in a justified attempt to stop a crime (including petty larceny). ***Women were approximately 100 times more likely to be killed by a man with a gun than to use a firearm in self defense*** [[source]](https://www.thenation.com/article/a-new-study-debunks-the-nras-claim-that-guns-protect-women/).

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, there were approximately 250,000 to 500,000 cases in 2018 in which guns were stolen from private owners, more than enough to provide a weapon for every instance of gun violence in the country [[source]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/gun-theft-us-firearm-survey). This indicates that ***gun owners were at least 173 times more likely to have a gun stolen by criminals than to use a gun in an attempt to stop a crime.***

&gt;***Edit:*** I'm not homosexual, I'm just not a jerk. Sometimes.

&gt;----

&gt;***EDIT 2:***
So it's more visible, I'm putting my response to /u/mustangls1 here:

&gt;I think you missed the point of the video. That guy was actually kinda pouring his hear out to what it meant to him, and others like him. He didn't sound like he really enjoyed it, but rather he understood crass/dark comedy enough to not be personally offended by Louis C.K. himself. But I bet if some rando on the street said it, he'd be highly offended.

&gt;First, and foremost, this wasn't in a comedic context like it was in the video presented. Crass humor has a very near and dear place in my heart. But here, it was used in a derogatory way. If it was supposed to be funny, his humor is too complex for satire over text.

&gt;It's not so much about sensitivity, it's about being em/sympathetic to your fellow human. If you're not capable of doing such a thing, then just say so, and we'll know how to react to you accordingly.

&gt;If you've ever been picked on, beaten up, segregated, ignored, outcast, what have you... then you know the feels. As lame as it may sound, if we don't start treating each other better, we're going to shorten our lives not only in the short term (anger and hatred shorten your generational life), but in due time we'll all end up murdering each other and causing genocidal-suicide before we know it. It may seem far fetched, but before white man invaded ""America,"" they natives were very territorial and murdered villages for sport. Imagine if we still did that today on that scale. Some might say ""the weak will die, and the strong will survive,"" but to what Pyrrhic end?

&gt;It's ok, mock if you will, I believe it just portrays your true personality, which will end up biting you in the ass at some point (if it hasn't already).

Why are people so damn sensitive?

I agree to a point...that point is.
(I already hate the fuck out of Europe for their politics, but I like how you can talk to almost anybody) They fuck with each other, they call each other names, and nobody gives a flying fuck. Our society has become overly PC (politically correct) and I'm quite tired of it. We've become so focused on not offending people that it's become offensive and ridiculous.

Who gives a fuck if you get called a derogatory term? I don't! I've been called them my whole life! But I don't let them phase me, I've been bullied, beaten up, I've defended myself and others, and I've been a social outcast at one of the schools I went to because of profiling. I have sensitivity, compassion, sympathy, and pride for my heritage. But I don't have sympathy for those that get riled up over words.

There's an old saying that I think you might have learned as a child, “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.""

8nq0fw,"Looking for male MTA employee with pregnant gf Looking for a man who matches this description without a lot to go on. Never done this before and not sure how to really help, but could not resist reaching out

(I am a woman; this was on my daily commute)
I was on an off peak LIRR train on one of the Port Jeff branches (blue line) this past afternoon and I (and everyone else in the vicinity) overheard a deeply disturbing phone conversation. 

I listened to your girlfriend ruthlessly, relentlessly insult you for a little over 45 minutes. At some point you had called her ""controlling"" and ""mentally unstable"", and based on what I heard, I want to tell you, from the very bottom of my heart, that I agree with you. I am only a concerned stranger, but I want to encourage you to really evaluate your relationship. 

In 45 minutes (including ~10min pause going through the tunnel w/o cell service) your kind and caring girlfriend:

* Was adamant to break up with you, citing that you were an asshole for whatever you said to her. According to her, you must've ""forgot"" about that thing inside of her (her words) because you dared to challenge her perspective of herself.
* Threatened to hurt/kill herself, and if she did it would be YOUR fault for ""making her."" She even said she was scratching herself, so hard to the point she was bleeding and it was ""all because of you"" (she wasn't, and it isn't). Classic manipulation tactic.
* Said you wrote her a note? Assuming it was a love note, too bad, because she already ""ripped it up and threw it out the window, because that's what she thinks of you.""
* Kept saying that she had hormones which was why she was allowed (even expected) to call you an endless stream of names and act out emotional extremes
* Repeatedly referred to her pregnancy as ""this thing inside me"" which got weirder every time she said it (so many times) because that's all she ever called it
* Mentioned something about ""going to a doctor and..."" Implying abortion as a threat so she could keep you on the line
* Demanded that you pick her from a train station that was way out of your way while she knew you had a prior commitment
* Prior commitment was to your own father who needed a ride to a doctor's appointment (something like that; i could only hear her side). She could not understand why your planned, prearranged obligation (that you were in middle of! literally on the way) wasn't dropped immediately to go pick her up during her tantrum.
* Insisted that she was more important than your dad and was SO pissed that you were trying to compromise and meet her at a different station. Her way or nothing, it seems.
* Didn't get off at Jamaica, where she was ""going to stand in the streets until either you pick me up or someone else does, I don't care."" An empty, melodramatic threat meant to scare you into doing what she wanted. 
* Could not FATHOM why you were ""sounding so depressed"" because you had no right to be, especially after having insults thrown at you for the better part of an hour. 
* Don't you remember what you said to her? She was ""controlling, mentally unstable, and should go back to Connecticut""? Based on the ""abuse"" dripping from those words, she was completely justified in reacting so aggressively, calling you belittling, truly demeaning names and questioning your intelligence.
* She explained to you exactly why she was right about ""your small brain."" Part of the reason why ""you don't understand what she was going through"" and why she was the only one with a reason to be upset. She wants you to believe that you're so dumb that you NEED her to tell you what to feel and when.
* Demanded that you apologize, but apparently didn't like the way you said it. Seemed disgusted that you were acting like ""a fucking depressed, sadboy"" when you were SUPPOSED to be comforting HER. You ""didn't sound like you wanted to make her happy"" and weren't saying sorry ""in a way that would make her smile."" She said this over and over on top of also screaming at you to ""talk more"" and ""talk faster"" so you can prove how sorry you were. This is all while you were driving, presumably trying to stay calm enough to safely operate a car.
* Went from hysterically crying to completely normal in an instant. Very abrupt and unsettling. I guess you told finally her what she wanted to hear. 
* After you hit your apology quota and literally made her happy (this is still the same girl who had been threatening to slit her wrists because you had the balls to bring up Connecticut) she shows her appreciation by shitting on your job, letting you know how pointless it is and how you're stupid for doing it. SHE would never ""waste her time"" on something that paid so little. I thought her advice to ""just quit your job and get a new one, it's not that hard"" was pretty insightful and inspired. She was still using her maliciously critical inflection instead of her happy one, so the next time you make her feel something you have to let her know she's got to use a matching tone of voice, too. Isn't that why she wouldn't accept your apology a minute ago? 
* I could go on, but it was basically just listening to more dehumanizing and disparaging commentary directed at you. This lady was fucking *awful* 

This woman maintained throughout the conversation that you were abusing her and that SHE ""was too nice to you."" This woman did nothing but hurl abuse at you the entire time. It was cruel and sickening to hear a person being spoken to the way she was berating you, and especially heartbreaking to hear coming from an adult. She continually threatened you, put you down, and had you convinced that you were the one who had to make it up to her. She said with the utmost conviction that ""you are worthless. you are nothing."" because you had the audacity to suggest hanging up the phone for a bit. The blatant lack of respect and basic courtesy was genuinely distressing, and we were a hostage audience. You were experiencing real emotional terrorism.

As a woman myself, I am all about women standing up for themselves and overcoming their abusers. I am pro choice and believe that women should absolutely be making informed decisions about their own bodies, whatever that may be. I can empathize with raging hormones and fluctuating moods. Hormones are not an excuse for how this woman was behaving. [This is the definition of abuse](http://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/abuse-defined/) and she raises SERIOUS red flags. You need to recognize that you are in an unhealthy situation and remove yourself as soon as possible.

I am not shy about cursing and I am not easily shocked, but your girl shook me to my core with her words. It was uncomfortable listening her go on like that, and it bothered me to witness such a vivid, unquestionable example of an emotionally abusive relationship out in public. It was bonafide bullying. The most unsettling thing was that it was clear she thought she was undeniably right in her actions and that she was proud of the way she handled everything. She called YOU a bad person and listed all the ""terrible"" things you said to her to back it up. NONE of those things (that she said you said and easily could've twisted however she wanted, but didn't) justified such an overreaction. She cursed at you, mocked you, and demeaned you at a level that was unnecessarily brutal, and then forced you into apologizing for ""making her do it."" This is not how someone who loves and respects you acts.  

In just 45 minutes of listening to your girlfriend, she showed me (and everyone around us) what kind of person she was. She showed us that she takes no responsibility or accountability for what she says or does. She uses guilt and shame to expertly manipulate you for her benefit. She is spoiled, immature, narcissistic, and irrational, but still considers herself perfectly stable. She thinks that YOU are the unstable one. This is a person who does not love you because they cannot. A person like this only cares about themselves. She even told you that she didn't love you; we all heard her. I was sick to my stomach, knowing there was a person she was directing all this hatred to, and she wasn't even talking to me. She felt comfortable enough to have this conversation in the middle of the day on a packed train. If this is how she is in public, I am nauseous thinking about what she says to you in private. Take a step back and think about if this is what you want in a partner. Are you okay with this?

If anything, just consider what I'm saying. Please know that no matter what she's said to you, no matter how badly she's made you feel: You do not need her. She needs you so she can exert power over someone. If it wasn't you, it'd be someone else. You do not deserve to be treated like this. If somebody claims to love you but does nothing to demonstrate that they do, you need to trust that instinct. Your feelings are nothing to belittle and mock, and they are yours to feel. You are not worthless-- your girlfriend would not be trying so hard to keep you under her control if you were. You survived without her before you met, and you will survive without her when she's gone. Anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship, doesn't matter where you're from, who you know, or how smart you are. They are subtle at first; elusive until they're not. Realize. Get out of there. 

This is a throwaway, but I will be checking in often in case anyone wants to reach out. From what I gathered through eavesdropping, this man works for the MTA (pretty sure as a conductor) and at least has close family in the Hicksville/Hempstead area. GF was getting off at either station (she said both so I can't be sure, but I'd put money on Hempstead). GF is originally from Connecticut, white, female, mid-late 20s, pregnant but not showing. Brownish/blondish hair. I assume the man is around the same age. It's a long shot, but if this sounds like someone you know, message me to confirm identity (I left out certain details to protect privacy) please point them in this direction so they can get help if they need it.

If you're out there, man, I'm sorry you're dealing with this. And depending on how you take it, I'm sorry for butting in. But you needed to know, and I haven't been able to let it go for the past few hours, so I wanted to at least try to say something. I just want you to know that I heard, I believe, and I'm on your side.

EDIT: before i start replying to anyone I just want to let people know that I figure the chances are super low that this guy every or anyone who knows him is gonna see this, but they're even lower if I don't try. Maybe there's a better way, if anyone wants to suggest something? 

Also I know that this post is long as fuck, I'm sorry about that, this situation just really blew me away and it was cathartic for me. Like close enough to watching a car accident but unable to stop it, yeah? Plus if I don't write things down right away I'll forget about them and I don't want to forget how shitty people can be. 

this woman enraged me so much i and i wanted to say something so badly but i was too afraid to cause a scene but then I felt awful for hours about it ugh it just really struck a chord with me

EDIT: I am not a MRA (I had to look that up)! Think of the girlfriend and boyfriend as Person A and Person B if you want instead. Also, I am extra sensitive to abusive situations because I witnessed my father emotionally and verbally abuse my mother for many years. I believe that some victims need advocates, and i also believe that as often as men are victims, there are many, MANY other times when they are not.",submission,NYC,1.0

i8evd57,"Not much to say? I thought my church was normal and the true church of God (just like any other cult, apparently). I thought and believed we were right and the chosen ones. We have like no other church, a true and living breathing apostle, a reflection of Jesus himself. I was desensitized to the pictures of this man being portrayed as Jesus with water under him, like how Jesus walked on water. I didn't really question, just blindly accepted that I was a lucky one and felt sad for the world. 

Now, I have been to the city, and around the city but only on the metro bus to school, home, and church. I never had money but I remember wishing I could help spread the word of God and save people's lives. I used to do stupid bullshit like when my cousin acted like she was a witch or being possessed I would bring the Bible out and say ""may the power of christ repel you"". To some extent it was just fun and games, to another I hoped that the ""demons"" that ""possessed"" her would leave so she could find God again.

I never considered the church a cult but then again, what was a cult? 

We did things like, go to church 3 times a day if we could, 5am, 9am, and finally 6:30pm. Like a good boy I went to school, stayed away from my gentile classmates and went directly home. The problem was that my classmates found me so strange they would bug me alot. Asking me why I tucked my shirt in, why I couldn't go to movie theaters, why I ate meat despite it being Easter, why I didn't believe in or celebrate x-mas. I would cry alot, I was a confused boy, the world was an evil place but I had to go to school and interact with them. I was heavily bullied, but mostly because I was a pushover and a timid, whiny crybaby, a fat kid with a bowl haircut. Funny enough, I hated going to church, it was so boring, and I would get so sleepy.

 I knew what music was and I knew the radio existed but I didn't understand what musicians were or what music was. On our long car rides to church it was church hymns all the way and some kids singing about loving your parents, being good, and never leaving the path of God. Imagine how guilty I felt when I heard my first song that resonated with me and became a guilty pleasure, Linkin park - Crawling. My brother brought a disc home that his friend gifted him, Linkin park hybrid theory. I felt so scared because it was devil music, but when Chester sang those lyrics, ~crawling in my skiiiin!~....it hit me deeper in my soul than any church song I ever heard.

Aw man, I'm sorry I went on a long rant. I ended up on reddit because of the church tho. If you want to know a bit more it's  r/exlldm 

If you read their stories they're similar to mine. 

I grew up depressed not knowing why, being told to just pray to God and feeling guilty for being human. I didn't interact much with people outside of church and school. Being online a lot tho, I knew and understood internet scams. I've never seen anyone be grifted or scammed in person. There are so many things I have yet to experience that sometimes I believe these things only exist in movies. So as someone who left the church, a part of me wanted to prove I don't need God to be a good human being, but my greediness also got the best of me because I've been on unemployment and I've been struggling to pay rent with the Seattle concrete strike.

lgd2pb,"Recruiting Participants (NY Metro Area)! Functional Brain Mechanisms Underlying the Anti-suicidal Effects of Buprenorphine in Opioid Use Disorder  

Thank you to the moderators of NYC for allowing me to post here!

I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to understand the effect of two medications (Buprenorphine and Morphine) on suicidal thoughts and brain activity in people who have opioid use disorder. We hope to develop a better understanding of how well these two medications help depression and suicidal thoughts. 

You may qualify if you are between the ages of 18-65, have opioid use disorder and suicidal thoughts. Participation involves detailed diagnostic set of interviews, brain imaging scan (MRI), and neuropsychological tasks. Eligible individuals will be hospitalized and receive free medication-based treatments for the duration of the study (3 weeks). You will have equal chance to receive either Buprenorphine or Morphine and you will not know which medication you are receiving until the end of the study. Three weeks of in-patient treatment will be offered AT NO COST to you.

cionq49,"I was born and raised in NYC, but people always thought I was from California (I had never been out west, nor had family from there). So that might say something about my personality.

I've been out of work both recessions. Was a web developer in between. Was terrible at it, finally just got tired of it and didn't advance my skills and let the Recession phase me out.

Spent the recession accumulating debt till I found some temp work. Worked for a University in Admissions. Tedious job, everyone hated me and I hated them. Am too much of a ""free spirit"", can't handle the bureaucrazy.

I liked the vibe of the small companies I worked for. Do you job, we don't care if you come in after 10am. People were from all walks of life, I liked hanging out with design, ia, engineering. People were off beat and that was ok. Except in engineering people were accepting of alternative lifestyles and orientations. I liked the creativity and freedom of the environment, but not the pretentiousness of the designers (though it was humorous), or that I wasn't nerdy enough for the engineers (I wasn't into working on my own server, coding, gaming in my spare time).

School and work I pretty much bomb at. I have trouble keeping focused and on track. I miss deadlines, I make careless errors no matter how much time I take or how assiduously I check my work (you'd think three times would be enough) I work hard, but miss deadlines and piss people off. Some people get me and know that I'm working hard, most people think I'm lazy or a slacker or rude on purpose. I battle mental illness depression/anxiety/mood disorder spectrum. It fucks with my concentration, motivation, and perspective. At least half my energy is devoted to staying stable, to constantly monitoring what I say and do to not make a misstep, to pulling myself out of depression to keep going, to working through anxiety that often paralyzes me to the point where I can't leave my room or make a decision (social anxiety or otherwise), to trying to ride out and not react to emotions that blow through me like storms so they don't dump on other people - I grew up with that shit and I really don't want to put someone else through that, it's really draining and stressful, no one needs more shit to deal with. While my moods are shifting I have to constantly find ways to reground as I go. Sometimes I'm paranoid, sometimes I'm positive, sometimes I'm angry, sometimes I'm down, it's really amazing how your perspective can shift in those states and how much effort it takes to find your way to as close to neutral as possible so you can function. I think most people have no idea. I suppose you can relate it to being ""carried away in the moment"", but imagine that all that comes internally and constantly, and you have to find your way back from constantly changing points. It's like being thrown around on a boat in the storm.

This was much doable when I was younger, but as you get older it's much harder, most people have settled into some form of lifestyle, family career and you get left behind. It's hard to connect to people when you have nothing in common with them. I was talking to a guy who's kinda in the same place as me, but he's organized and seems like a balanced person so it's interesting to see his struggle. His thing is that all the people he knows have low paying jobs and no ambition (ie he doesn't see himself working as a bartender or minimum wage job for life). My problem is that everyone I knew became successful white collar workers, many with children/families that take up their time. I can't spend time with them or identify with a lifestyle I can't afford. But he's somewhat close to my age (I recently turned forty, that's a tough one). I think he'll be ok though, he has an idea of what he wants to do and he's good at organizing and planning. I hope so anyway, I don't like the idea of people being stuck like this, it's no place to be.

I've never really gotten along well with my peers, never identified with them. I am an outlier as I have no kids, am eclectic, I am traditional in ways that makes me an outsider to people in alternative communities (I am on the spectrum ie bisexual. Straight people and gay people both discriminate for different reasons. I am not a commodity for your play, I don't share or do poly relationships, I am not into kink or bdsm, though I think these are all acceptable lifestyles even if they don't accept me. I'm half christian half jewish, but I fit neither). When people listen to me they either say that ""you're different"" ""you have an interesting view on things"" that I'm unrealistic, a dreamer, naive, practical, cynical, depressing, or some label that differentiates me from the rest.

I've thought about becoming a therapist, which would give me some freedom in hours, but I have to attend the dreaded school. It's too expensive and I don't have the academic skills. I hate therapy I think it's mostly bullshit and impractical. I think people just miss stages and skills in life, or have off brain chemistry and just need a little help in practical skills to help them cope. I don't know many modes of therapy for this. I know that I want to help people in some capacity, I'm good at listening. I know also that I want to protect the environment in some manner, though that's probably the most discouraging job in the world.

ifdiqkl,"This depressing article by Andrea Estes doesn't mention (and should have mentioned) that the solution to many of these issues already exists: juvenile diversion programs. They still have the potential to administer community-based retributive justice in a manner more satisfying to the victim and more helpful to prevent repeat offenses by the perpetrator than court processes.

&gt; “The harm of student information ending up in law enforcement databases, including gang databases . . . is so great that it was a necessary step to limit that sharing of information,” said Leon Smith, executive director of Boston-based Citizens for Juvenile Justice.

It's unclear whether Smith is referring to examples of diverted students being added to these databases.

Diverted students shouldn't ever have their names added to a database except a database of students who have gone through a diversion process, and that list should be in the hands of DA, not with the police. On the other hand, if Smith is referring to students who are repeat offenders and have already been through diversion, then of course their names should be in appropriate law enforcement databases and his organization should change its name to Boston-based Citizens Supporting Crime.

Similar questions about diversion should have been included elsewhere in the story. Maybe there is almost no diversion in Suffolk County compared to other parts of the state. I have no idea because Estes didn't ask. If there is sufficient diversion then that information needs to trickle down to the schools, so they share more with the police. If there isn't sufficient diversion then the schools are behaving in a reasonable way by leaving the justice system in the dark until more diversion programs are present.

 5. I lived in Boston for about five years. Mostly I have contrasts as I really didn't like Boston:
- bus drivers are generally nicer, they will actually stop and wait if they see you running
- winters are much milder, usually we get like one day of snow that closes everything down, then melts
- summers are nicer too, Boston summers are almost as sweltering and humid as what I grew up with in New Orleans, Seattle summers can get hot but are rarely very humid
- I don't feel like I'm flouting an unwritten law when I go out in public dressed in bright colors with unnaturally-colored hair
- there is green EVERYWHERE, tons more trees than you have in Boston, and a lot of them are evergreens so they don't turn into stark depressing twigs for half the year
- much straighter streets in general, which means navigation is much less maddening and you can regularly see for more than two blocks (see my comment on question 2 about tons of views)
- Seattle has no equivalent to Boston's giant inferiority complex regarding NYC. Seattle is pretty happy to just be itself.
- Like any West Coast city, Seattle is a lot more spread out than Boston. Much less so than most, due to its geographical constraints, but downtown streets are wider and more open. When I first visited here while I was living in Boston, I had happy flashbacks to what I missed about living in Los Angeles. If you've ever visited any cities on the West Coast you'll find there are lots of things that remind you of them more than the East.
- buildings are NOT ALL BROWN AND GREY oh god things have COLOR here to try and stave off the winter blahs instead of embracing them by making everything out of brick and stone
- wider streets and a mostly grid layout = much nicer drivers, Boston basically REQUIRES you to drive like an asshole because there is no room.",comment,Seattle,0.0

Here's some photos. The text in one of them says ""Are you busy lately? It's a little cold here isn't it? Have you eaten anything today?""

 [**General Motors streetcar conspiracy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General%20Motors%20streetcar%20conspiracy): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __General Motors streetcar conspiracy__ (also known as the __Great American streetcar scandal__) refers to allegations and convictions in relation to a program by [General Motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors) (GM) and other companies who purchased and then dismantled [streetcar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram) and [electric train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_locomotive) systems in many cities in the United States.

&gt;Between 1936 and 1950, [National City Lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_City_Lines) and [Pacific City Lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_City_Lines)—with investment from GM, [Firestone Tire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_Tire), [Standard Oil of California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil_of_California), [Phillips Petroleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_Petroleum), [Mack Trucks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_Trucks), and the Federal Engineering Corporation—purchased electric surface-traction systems in 45 cities including [St. Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis), [Baltimore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore), [Newark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newark,_New_Jersey), [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles), [Oakland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California) and [San Diego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego) and converted them into [bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus) operations. Several of the companies involved were convicted in 1949 of [conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_(crime\)) to [monopolize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly) interstate commerce but were acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the ownership of these companies.

&gt;Some suggest that this program played a key role in the decline of public transit in cities across the United States; notably Edwin J. Quinby, who first drew attention to the program in 1946, and then Bradford C. Snell, an [anti-trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law) [attorney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_at_law) for the [United States Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate) whose controversial 1974 testimony to a Senate inquiry brought the issue to national awareness. Both Quinby and Snell argued that the deliberate destruction of streetcars was part of a larger strategy to push the United States into [automobile dependency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_dependency).  Others say that independent economic factors brought about changes in the transit system, including the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression), the [Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Utility_Holding_Company_Act_of_1935), [labor unrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_unrest), [market forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy), rapidly increasing [traffic congestion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_congestion), the [Good Roads Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Roads_Movement), [urban sprawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_sprawl), taxation policies that favored private vehicle ownership, and general enthusiasm for the automobile.  More recently Guy Span, a noted writer on the subject has suggested that Snell and others fell into simplistic [conspiracy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory) thinking, bordering on [paranoid delusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_delusions)  saying ""Clearly, GM waged a war on electric traction. It was indeed an all out assault, but by no means the single reason for the failure of rapid transit. Also, it is just as clear that actions and inactions by government contributed significantly to the elimination of electric traction.""

Like this?

[The latest data show that people use guns for self-defense only rarely. According to a Harvard University analysis of figures from the National Crime Victimization Survey, people defended themselves with a gun in nearly 0.9 percent of crimes from 2007 to 2011.](https://www.npr.org/2018/04/13/602143823/how-often-do-people-use-guns-in-self-defense)




&gt;It varies widely but the low estimate in the CDC study is that there are 500k 

Page 45 of that study puts the low end at 60k......


And, like it says above, theses numbers are unreliable. 

&gt; if you discount suicide

Why would you do that? Does it cease to be a firearm death if it’s a suicide?

Okay. Recent PubMed and NIH literature reviews of veterinary medicine journals, not to mention Janssen Pharmaceutica themselves say otherwise and attribute it to the fact that the kI of CFTN for Mu receptors is 0.057 nM, well the fuck below it's maximal plasma values and over dose activity is observed at 1 &lt; 1.50 &gt; 2.0 **micrograms** in adult humans. Despite the poor permeability of synthetic opioids in general across the skin, the dosages are low enough to be dangerous even with the shit diffusion coefficients. Not to mention there is a suspected suicide inhibition mechanism behind it where it sheds a leaving group and forms covalent bonds that can't be dislodged from a patients Opiod receptors, meaning narcan has just another reason to work on top of it's kI 0.79 being orders of magnitude larger than Carefentanyl. (Van Bever, Niemegeers, and Janssen, 1976) (Jones, Krzywicki, Maginnis, 2008) (Henderson, at al., 2016)

 “hard to imagine someone would need multiple doses of naloxone after transient skin contact with powdered fentanyl,”

But we're not talking about Fentanyl, we're talking about an ethylamide substituted derivative of Fentanyl which is far less stericly inhibited due to charge repulsion from the additional amide group. (Kronstrand et al. 2017)

Now I agree that the permeability of these drugs is poor across the skin because they're large, stericly hindered molecules with bulky attachments to contend with. The problem is things like CFTN are so fucking toxic that the little that makes it across the membrane is dangerous. This is only exacerbated if you've got any sort of recent wound.

dyt9b1e,"Fair enough.

I agree that they can be improved upon, but everyone seems to think strict = improved. Like you said, the goal is make it harder for criminals to get guns without unreasonably burdening good citizens. I can confidently say that this is a pretty non-partisan objective that no reasonable person on either side would object to. The issue is the vast majority of new and proposed laws throw out the second part of that objective, and usually don't even do the first part that well.

Instead of making good citizens jump through more hoops and restrict what they can or can't own, why not improve the back end of the NICS background checks and ensure local authorities are contributing to the database? 

Or even better, why not treat the illness instead of the symptom? Help uplift the areas most effected by gun violence and give young men more opportunities so they don't have to turn to crime? If we magically made all the guns go away but have the same amount of criminals, do we really expect the violence to decrease? Perhaps, but more likely we will see a proportional increase in knife violence instead of gun violence, and then are are London banning Swiss army knives. 

Gun control has its place. We have a hell of a lot more of it now than we use to have before I was born, and I'm OK with that. I personally think it is completely reasonable that you can't buy a fully automatic Thompson machine gun from the back of a magazine and have it delivered to your door like people use to be able to do. That's good and reasonable gun legislation. What really bothers me though is that there are organizations like the Brady Campaign that spend millions of dollars on pushing this deeply anti-gun narrative like it is some magic bullet. The sheer amount of effort that is wrongly directed at guns could be put such better use in the community. It is depressing.

Would very strict gun control *in some way* decrease overall violence? Almost definitely, I don't deny that. But the cost is immense. Massive amounts of money and effort spent by the government. Huge swaths of disgruntled citizens, 99.9% of who had never and would never do anything wrong. Further division in our already disturbingly fractured and caustic political environment.

e4eu6hn,"I was depressed after a traumatic childhood incident; I felt isolated from a young age and trapped in my mind. For years I accepted that I would be alone in all sense of the word.

I didn’t expect that this drive would invigorate me, give me meaning, and allow a personality to blossom.

I was born raised and now continue to live in Brooklyn (sunset park). I wanted to go to UB because I wanted to learn to become independent and yadda yadda yadda whatever. Now I’m in debt and 2 years past my graduation and I regret going there. I have so many traumas from my time there (and I’m a dude for some perspective). I felt very alienated during my time there. I developed some severe depression and anxiety. I’m Latino, and even the other Latinos there were pretty affluent compared to myself (lower middle class potentially low class person). I was never able to afford a car and thus I missed out on a plethora of experiences. My friends that I made, I love them, but fuck me I realized they were kinda lame. They never did anything cool or fun or spontaneous and so with that in mind, I would say it’s important to make good friends if you’re gonna be up there, because at the same time some people who came from similar backgrounds to myself still found ways to have a good time by surrounding themselves with some similar people. They made friends that related to them but I never did. I went into the honors college and dormed with them and all I ever did was meet people who were very affluent from areas in upstate or especially Long Island. I felt horribly isolated a lot of the time. I never felt connected with anyone. I would make sure to also do a major that you’re actually interested in because going through a major you don’t actually enjoy is hell (I did civil engineering and looking back I wish I had done something in computer science instead, I’m teaching myself programming rn though). Anyways, as a result of all my traumas I became an alcoholic and I delved into other addictions too.

All in all, it’s only worth it if you meet good people, stay true to yourself, and learn about yourself. Right now I’m still learning about myself and I feel very far behind in life despite having a decent job and having graduated with a decent gpa and degree. I have far too many traumas that I didn’t mention from

It's really sad to me that you see people as being generally shitty. Have you ever wondered that perhaps the reason that terrible things are documented in history is because they were uncharacteristically horrible things for society at the time? Of course history is going to remember that which negatively impacted it. That's how we learn not to do it again. 

Why is that a sad day? Facebook, yelp, twitter, etc. are all public forums where people can talk to each other and let people know what is going on in the world. That is a wonderful thing and a great advancement for society. I absolutely think that if twitter had been around in the 1960s, we would be living in a very different, better world most likely. What if every single time a black man was lynched, it was posted on twitter and millions of people saw it? You think that people would be able to ignore that? I don't think so.

c3kc5q,"Top 10 Reasons NYC cannot compete with Los Angeles Hey so it seems like one of of my shitposts on r/NYC got people upset on this subreddit as they took personal offense about me being an ass with regards to Los Angeles. Normally I wouldn't post here because r/NYC is the last free speech subreddit where the mods don't do shit, but since I feel bad, here are the top 10 Reasons Los Angeles is better than NYC:

1. Car ownership. Owning a car in NYC is an absolute nightmare. Parking is impossible, police love to give tickets for going the wrong way on a one way street, and then violate the law themselves, there's $15 tolls to drive into the city from New Jersey, and congestion pricing will be enacted.

2. Climate. It snows in NYC and since the city is a toilet, during the winter months you'll see these huge heaps of black snow full of trash, debris, and junk.

3. New Yorkers. For those of you who have never met a New Yorker, imagine the arrogance, hubris, and self-indulgence of a San Franciscan. Now multiply that by 10. New Yorkers are some of of the most unnecessarily mean, cocky, and hurtful people you'll ever meet. In neighborhoods they literally need signs that say ""No Honking Fine $200"" because New Yorkers can't stop being jerks on the road.

4. Prices. New York is overpriced by every measure. Even if you factor in a higher wage and more offerings, it's still way way overpriced. That's why they say NYC is great to visit but not to live.

5. There's nothing to do outside of Manhattan. In Los Angeles you have diversity with downtown, beaches, mountains, and more. In NYC it's Manhattan and that's it. There is literally nothing else of interest in the surrounding area.

6. New York State is depressing. NYC sucks the energy out of the surrounding areas, and upstate New York is experiencing a crisis of people leaving. Old industrial cities like Albany, Buffalo, and Syracuse contain tons of abandoned buildings and an air of depression, like you know its golden days are behind them, and that's mostly because no city can compete with NYC.

7. Hustle culture. In New York time is money, meaning you are not allowed to enjoy life whatsoever. If you block someone's path they will cuss you out and then keep walking. Life is not meant to be enjoyed, it's meant to be able to afford Manhattan or die trying.

8. Selfish people. New Yorkers are willing to burn bridges because they consider you replaceable in a city of 8.5 million people. They almost never tip, they are more likely to leave you a 1 star review even if you even service them, and they can and will try and squeeze every dollar out of you they can. It's scarcity mentality and it makes for a stressful experience.

9. New York is a toilet. It's disgusting, there are rats everywhere, inhumane living conditions just because it's New York, trash on the sidewalks, and just an overall filth everywhere. Go to a movie theater and the seats are tattered with food still in the floor, even though you are paying full price for the experience.

10. Lack of opportunity. NYC is tapped out, it has hovered around 8.5 million people for at least the last 20 years. Los Angeles is a growing city in a growth area of the country, and between the two Los Angeles is on the upswing while NYC will only stay relevant because of Wall Street.

cyr74fn,"It's quite common for depressed people to think moving to NYC will somehow cure them of their perceived boredom with where they live.

They think that they will be fully immersed in all the great things they've seen/heard of NYC, and suddenly they'll be interesting and have fun things to do.

San Franciscans know they’ll see all walks of life along Market Street, but a new fixture on the colorful thoroughfare has shocked even the most hardened city dwellers: a 6-week-old, homeless baby girl.

All day long, Megan Doudney, 34, sits on the sidewalk near the Four Seasons Hotel between Third and Fourth streets with little Nedahlia in her arms and a sign reading, “Anything helps.” The sight is alarming, even in this city where just about anything goes.

Pedestrians walking past do double takes, exclaiming, “Oh my God!” or “She has a baby!” But they’re not on some hidden-camera show. This is very much real life.

Several people have called 911, including when another homeless person’s menacing dog got in the baby’s face. Police have responded numerous times, and child welfare workers from the Human Services Agency have investigated whether the baby should be removed from Doudney. At first blush, it seems obvious that’s the right answer, but so far, the city is throwing up its hands. Apparently, the newborn is healthy and developing well, and isn’t going anywhere.

“I’m not harming her in any way,” Doudney told me as we chatted on the sidewalk the other day.

She held the sleeping baby, who was wrapped in a fluffy blue blanket. She noted a medical checkup required by the child welfare workers a couple of weeks ago found the baby had low blood sugar but was otherwise fine. And what if the city did try to remove the baby?

“They’d have a fight on their hands — a serious, serious fight,” said Doudney, who sports short blue dreadlocks. “I love her. I wanted my entire life to be a mommy. Even when I was a little kid in school, they’d say, ‘What do you want to be when you grow up?’ I always said, ‘A mommy.’”

Now she is one. But should she be? At least while she’s on the streets? Like everything about the city’s homeless problem, there is no easy answer.

Doudney and her baby have a private room at Hamilton Family Shelter, where they sleep every night and have access to three meals a day and parenting classes. The room is hers for three to six months, and she’s working with a case manager to figure out what comes next. Doudney receives $900 a month in Social Security benefits, and Hamilton sets aside 75 percent of that to save for her future.

Doudney said she needs more than the remaining $225 a month to afford diapers, formula, clothes and other necessities — and that she must panhandle every day to get it.

Rachel Kenemore, development and communications manager at Hamilton, said Doudney is keeping all her appointments with her case manager and that “she seems to be really caring and capable.”

She said staff has no concerns about the baby’s health.

“We have just felt a lot of empathy for Megan,” Kenemore said. “It’s hard to see folks throwing blame instead of looking at this from a compassionate viewpoint of ‘What can we do to ensure this isn’t happening?’”

Chandra Johnson, spokeswoman for the Human Services Agency, wouldn’t discuss Doudney’s specific case, for confidentiality reasons. But she said that, in general, a baby remains with his or her parent unless there is abuse, neglect or failure to develop.

“It’s really important to remember that being homeless alone is not a reason that our agency would remove a child from a family,” she said.

Logically, that seems right. In the heart and in the gut, though, there’s still something wrong about seeing a newborn baby on Market Street all day as her mother panhandles. Doudney has clearly made a string of bad decisions. And if the city can’t compel her to make different choices, its outreach workers should at least attempt to coax her into placing her baby in day care on the city’s dime. The city offers subsidies for homeless families to find free day care for their children so they can work or otherwise get their lives in order.

That kind of help would be more effective than the shaming some passersby on Market Street have tried. Doudney’s image has been splashed all over social media and Next Door email lists, the jaw-dropping pictures of a homeless baby shared like selfies.

The story got even more stomach-churning earlier last week when a North Beach artist spent hours standing over Doudney holding a big pink sign reading, “Women Against Child Abuse!” and followed her for blocks after the homeless mother moved on. Doudney is adamant that she’s not exploiting her child and that she shouldn’t be treated like a freak show just because she’s destitute.

“I am human,” she said. “You can stop and talk to me. You don’t have to shake your head and give me dirty looks.”

When asked about herself, Doudney was candid, coherent and friendly. She said she grew up in a poor family in Fremont, Neb., graduated from high school and attended cosmetology school. Scoliosis and chronic back pain led her to become hooked on opioids.

She said she came to San Francisco on a Greyhound bus five years ago seeking medical marijuana for her pain and that she now uses no hard-core drugs. She does smoke cigarettes heavily, though. She said she has been diagnosed with depression and has had suicidal tendencies in the past, but is doing better. She still talks to family in Nebraska sometimes, but doesn’t want to go back there.

She said she dated a guy for a couple of months — “long enough to get pregnant” — before he became abusive. He’s not in her life and not paying child support. Doudney was sleeping on the streets while pregnant, but received help from the Homeless Prenatal Program and got into a shelter just before giving birth at St. Luke’s Hospital. City officials would not verify Doudney’s story.

Martha Ryan, executive director of Homeless Prenatal, said it’s very rare to see a homeless mother be so public with her baby. But she said there are many more like Doudney. She said in the last month alone, her nonprofit helped 32 women who are homeless and pregnant in San Francisco. The group recently encountered a mother living in her car with a 2-week-old.

“I don’t like to see them on the streets panhandling, but what are you going to do?” Ryan said. “You can’t penalize a mother because she is homeless and living in a shelter and have her baby taken away.”

Doudney’s only friend in San Francisco is Efrem Bryan, a 54-year-old homeless man who is almost always sitting next to her in his wheelchair. They met within hours of her arrival at the Transbay Terminal five years ago and have been inseparable since.

“She’s taking beautiful, great care of the child,” he said, adding he doesn’t understand why the mom and baby have sparked such a fuss. “I thought this was America. I thought this was the land of the free.”

Doudney is vague about her future plans, but said she wants to be off the streets by the time her baby can remember things. And as for her dreams for her girl?

“I just want her to be happy,” she said. “That’s it.”

d8qr5cw,"&gt; Previously the Oregon minimum corporate tax was $10. That was set back during the great depression.
&gt; A few years ago, there was a vote to raise it to $30. At the time we saw all the same ads that we see now, companies are going to raise prices, people will leave the state, ""they're TRIPLING OUR TAXES!!!"", etc.
&gt; None of that happened.

Actually, I believe they raised it to either $100 or $150. That was just an increase to an annual flat fee, and affected s-corporations which are typically small businesses.

Measure 97 is completely different, in that the amount of the tax is a function of the transaction amount, like a sales tax, and it is also held on the balance sheet as a current liability, like a sales tax.

The main difference between Measure 97 and a sales tax, is whether or not the affected businesses have pricing power to pass it on to the consumer. If they do, it is essentially the same as a sales tax. Businesses that do not have pricing power will be impacted, and need to take steps to continue to operate in the black, possibly by finding efficiencies and/or trimming payroll, etc.

For businesses that are uncertain as to whether they have pricing power, it is a little like playing a game of chicken with the government, with the government forcing them to collect the tax, and the business assuming the risk of being run off the road.

With Comcast, I'd guess they will just add the fee in like the other line item fees, because we're a captive audience. I tried Centurylink and it was even worse, with ongoing billing problems that were extremely difficult to resolve.

edit: I think there is both an annual registration fee for Oregon corps, and also a minimum tax for Oregon s-corporations, one of which may be $100, the other $150. Iirc they are both flat fees, and not a function of any transaction amount(s).",comment,Portland,1.0

ljyne04,"Yeah, they're my parents. They've been keeping up with all my struggles and therapy and stuff. Tbh they even enabled my meth addiction a bit so I kind of hold that against them but they were just trying to help me get treatment for my ADHD because they did see me get a lot of benefit during the earlier period when I got the pills that only contained amphetamines, and how much difficulty I had even back then in getting the medication I needed from psychiatrists. But yeah, it wasn't a great idea for them to fund their kid's meth addiction >. >. 

Anyways, I'm copying my history in case you missed it in my edit. It explains my rationale for why I think I would benefit from higher doses and why I don't think I actually have bipolar. 

_____________
Depressive episodes while they have been clear emotional overreactions, have had obvious triggers due to life events and have not been random events. ""Mania/hypomania"" has been from dumbfuck substance abuse. Never has happened organically. Yes, I have abused substances. 

But I had a one year period where I managed to obtain pills that only contained pressed amphetamine sulfate. I don't know what their exact strength was, but I took about 5 of these on top of my prescription. During this period, my ADHD was finally properly treated and I was able to take graduate level classes at my local state college, did very well. My sleep was normal, I sometimes measured my heart rate and blood pressure and it was never significantly elevated. Although my heart rate was high, but I was simply out of shape. 

Eventually, this supplier disappeared. I thought since Desoxyn, which was literal meth, was also an ADHD med, then maybe I could try taking meth to self-medicate my ADHD. Terrible idea. This led to a year long period of bad mood swings, which is also why I thought I had bipolar. 

But now that I've been free of substance abuse for many months, and can reflect on all of these 5 years,  I understand that no, I did not have bipolar. I was just addicted to meth. But a higher dose of Adderall in the form of amphetamine sulfate pills did still benefit me without causing any problems, which is why I am seeking a way to legally medicate myself now.",comment,LosAngeles,1.0

Does gang violence change the gun violence thought? Or do you use it as a stat to accomplish your disarmament goal?

We tried to solve the crack problem by putting people in prison in the 80s, and that put so many people in jail, that many agree that the affected communities were negatively affected by breakup in families, etc. 

A related example is that some homeless people put such a tremendous drain on the local ER and police, that it's cheaper to pay their rent and hire a social worker than to deal with their constant ER visits. This is maddeningly frustrating, as people who go to work and live life well don't get their rent paid for, but people who are losers in life are being given free apartments. Though, not only is this offensive, it's also effective, in that is actually does seem to cost less over all.

So treatment does seem to be the answer, though it's not a feel good answer. And that still leaves us with the dilemma that between drugs, depression, and other mental health issues, it sometimes seems like the people who don't need counseling are in the minority.

It impacts people differently.  Some people with depression sleep constantly and can barely wake up.  Some can't sleep at all.

And for me?  Fuck it.  I can't sleep either way, coffee or no coffee, caffeine or no caffeine.  Doesn't impact me one way or the other.  =)  

Also - it doesn't matter if the drinkers are having decaf or regular coffee.  There are plenty of other compounds in the coffee bean that help. 

I highly recommend this book:  http://www.amazon.com/World-Caffeine-Science-Culture-Popular/dp/0415927234/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317220765&amp;sr=8-3

iojydyg,"It sounds like a nice suggestion, but it isn't realistic. 



Hospitals are at max capacity with next to no staff, you go to an ER if you're actively dying or going to die if you don't. Anything else, even if you do show up at the ER they will send you elsewhere. BMC's facility as most hospitals' in regards to suicidal ideation is mostly to speak to you and then send you to the first place that has a bed if they determine you are suicidal. You do not get a choice on where you go, and as OP has stated in another comment was quoted nearly $10,000 for ONE NIGHT. If you go to the ER and tell them you're about to kill yourself, you are going to be sectioned off and sent off against your will. You can't just go there, say you want to kill yourself and then ask for a list of what you think is best for you, that's not how it works. Then you're at a mental institution you didn't pick and have no choice to be at, which often have tons of abuse and many are basically just a security guard making sure you don't off yourself, with no other real assistance. So you pay $10k a night for someone to watch you sometimes, and also possibly get badly mistreats while you're there. I mean...

OP may not be able to get Mass Health, depends upon their exact situation though and agreed they should check up on it. 

Our mental health system is incredibly broken and has a million roadblocks at every turn, we have a high suicide rate for a reason. Telling suicidal people to just go to the ER SHOULD work and be a good solution, but it isn't. You can look up this very subject on Reddit and see the loads of posts of people who did this or other well intentioned people who made calls out of concern, and how that further ruined their lives. 


OP is much better suited to find resources outside of an ER that can help; those will vary widely based upon why they're feeling the way that they do. Boston is probably one of the best places in the nation for that -- there should be good help, as long as you know where to look. You go to an ER only if you're going to die if you don't, that's the general rule no matter if it's mental health related or not.",comment,Boston,1.0

In the early to mid-90's I'd bike from downtown on a weekend night after catching a band etc., usually between 11pm and 3am, and head home to either Rosedale or the northern part of Hyde Park. I would usually pass by an average of 5 or 6  parties every time. 

No matter what route you took through Hyde Park you were going to encounter a few keg parties, same went for North Campus (West campus was a given), and if you decided to join one of those parties you could usually do that and be more than welcome. The door was usually, literally, wide open.

I still ride my bike on some of those old routes on occasion, at the same late hours, but now it's completely still, silent, dead. Even though I'm older now and less interested in keg parties, it's still a bit depressing to see that the old core of youthful vibrancy, openness, free flowing Shiner Bock, and music wafting through the air, and late night people on the streets, and so on and so forth, is gone forever.

The inner core has been gentrified and made quiet, family oriented, sanitized (and there are many positives about that development as well, don't get me wrong.)

No politician is going to win support by undermining existing laws, nor removing consequences for blatant law breakers, especially in a housing crisis, its such a bad look politically. And, if you look into recent news articles on the subject, and just how bad new housing obstructionism got on the civic level, you'll find stuff that will make your blood boil. San Francisco's Building Department, and what appears to be the majority of local California governments, routinely sabotaged all new housing, sometimes legally, but far too often via illegal and totally unethical means, AS A MATTER OF POLICY. The craftier officials abused the public input process and intentionally created insane regulatory hurdles to delay projects to the point that they became financially impossible. Its a real ugly chapter in our history, and the housing shortage was manufactured on the local level, by almost every individual city government in the State.

d28todz,"Talking about universal background checks for all transfers. Clearly based on this conversation the ATF data is really limited. 

I'm also not saying there's been a relaxation, I'm saying that our gun homicide/suicide rate is too high. There's more hunting and fewer people per mile in NH, so I think their lax viewpoint on guns isn't as much of a problem as it is in a metro area like Boston — and NH (somewhat understandably) doesn't really care about what happens outside of their state, so state regulation can only go so far. I think universal background checks/tracking could potentially help the issue in state law inconsistency. 

&gt;Shouldn't you be worried about unlicensed drivers needlessly endangering us all! Confiscate the cars of unlicensed drivers and crush them. Put the drivers in jail for year and then prohibit that person from ever touching a car again. That's what it's like for gun owners.

You can't bring an out of state car and license it in MA without registering a proper title. If you do you'll be fined and eventually the car could be confiscated and destroyed. If you drive while unlicensed you're fined and prohibited from being licensed, and if you do it enough that prohibition increases. So what it's like for drivers isn't too far off, and for people in most parts of the country cars are more utility than privilege — our rate of gun ownership likely shows the opposite trend.

No one needs a gun to get to work, and if they need a gun for work then require special permitting just like CDL drivers. I personally don't want Joe Sixpack walking around with a gun because he's paranoid about terrorism and thinks the way things were back in the late 1700s was all sunshine and rainbows. In the same breath, I'll be more than happy to replace drivers with automated systems because our ""one drivers test for your entire life"" policy is garbage, and you're right — driving is incredibly dangerous.

Plenty of people suffering depression during lockdown have latched on to ""long covid"" to explain their lack of energy and muscle pain.

I will at least hold your hand to an *accessible* article, since I understand that reviewing scientific literature takes a certain amount of background education that not everyone has.

&gt; These effects, though unnerving, aren’t unprecedented. Chronic symptoms, especially fatigue, have lingered after the typical recovery periods for viruses as varied as West Nile, Polio, Dengue, Zika, seasonal flu, and H1N1 as well as the new coronavirus’s cousins MERS and SARS-1. Run-of-the-mill strep throat can develop into rheumatic fever, which can cause fatigue, painful joints, and fluid buildup around the heart. While reporting this story, I realized I was once a long hauler. I lost a summer in college to mononucleosis, caused by the Epstein-Barr virus; for weeks, I had no appetite and could hardly muster the energy to get out of bed.

&gt;The phenomenon, sometimes called “post-viral syndrome,” has been documented for more than a century, as far back as the 1918 Spanish flu, when there were Spanish flu long-haulers — scores of people who survived the deadly virus but had long-term symptoms, including depression, sleeplessness, “loss of muscular energy,” and “nervous complications.”

&gt;Even “Covid dementia” isn’t really new: According to a recent historical review, early reports of the “common symptom of altered cognition” surfaced during the Russian flu pandemics of 1889 and 1892.

&gt;“I can’t find a single thing that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can do, that other viruses cannot,” Proal said. “It’s well understood and it’s been understood for decades that every major pathogen capable of infecting people has a syndrome associated with it in which a certain number of patients who get that pathogen,” she continued, “will develop chronic symptoms that never go away.”(https://www.vox.com/22298751/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-hauler-symptoms)",comment,Seattle,1.0

The main point still being we shouldn't be grouping up at all.  
  
&gt; but please be specific on what I'm disregarding.  
  
Already stated what.

I'm sorry, that's beyond dumb. The only thing I'm picking out is your terrible arguments, and pointing out the flaws.

&gt; I've been hiding inside for 6+ months because of the ineptitude of this admin. I've had almost 4 years of depression and anxiety in the face of the lies and bullshit this admin has put in my face. fuck that.  
  
You're not the only one that's had shit happen?

lewpgc1,"In some ways the tech jobs boom has been a catastrophe for Seattle. Even without the geographic restriction from bodies of water, if a mid-sized city gets 100,000 new jobs that pay $200,000 then hundreds of thousands of people from around the world will pour in to bid up the prices on everything. Basically too many jobs in one place. The wealth is the problem.

Chicago has the opposite situation, having peaked decades ago with a steady population decline keeping housing prices depressed while the jobs there stagnated.

I know the first obvious ostensible cause to the visible homeless crisis of Seattle is drug addiction, but we need to look at why there is more here than in other places that have the same drugs. It’s the housing costs. West Virginia has more addicts and overdosed per capita but they don’t have an equivalent corresponding homelessness crisis because they have cheap homes that even drug addicts can afford, which makes those addicts more stable and likely to work, which makes the whole society function better.

New York has high housing costs without the same visible homelessness because they invest more in shelters and other resources for that population. The Seattle area should do the same and as one of the wealthiest places to ever exist we can certainly afford to do so.",comment,Seattle,0.0

i9lpze1,"It sounds like you might have some anxiety and/or perseveration about severe mental illness. Might be worth talking to your psychiatrist about this. You might need treatment for anxiety. I would avoid using alcohol or benzodiazepines to treat anxiety, as these can very easily lead to habituation/dependence, and loss of mental functioning. You might have a touch of OCD. Or, you're just perfectly healthy and concerned. 

When I was in my early 20's, I also had a preoccupation with becoming severely mentally ill, as my paternal grandmother had been institutionalized for some sort of psychotic disorder. I'd believed that it was schizophrenia, but now I believe it was more likely severe bipolar depression with psychotic episodes. I was terrified that this could happen to me. In retrospect, I believe that I was suffering from pretty significant anxiety/depression, but was functional enough to get by and do well professionally and personally, albeit with the weight of constant worry/fear.

You're not alone.

We as a country are doing a terrible job of helping people who have mental illness that is incapacitating, due to some weird misguided belief that incapacitated people ""have the right"" to decide (without mental faculty) how they want to live (on the street with little/poor shelter, food, protection.) The stress of being cold, hungry, viciously attacked can only make mental illness WORSE. This is a stain on our country. It is a SHAME on our politicians that they have done nothing. 

Then there are the people who have, by using stimulant drugs like cocaine and methamphetamines, created psychosis and disability, where, if they didn't use the drugs, they would NOT be psychotic. And I am certain that there is a fair bit of overlapping pathologies--those people with natural psychotic disorders who also use drugs. 

Some people are prone to psychosis from using marijuana (but most are not, I would say, and can safely use THC.) 

I would try to make an appointment with a psychiatrist or even your family medicine physician first to discuss your concerns. My bet is that because you're asking, you're less likely to have psychosis. As others have advised, stay away from drugs--try to live a clean life. Get good sleep in a dark room for 7 to 8 hours at night, not under the influence of alcohol. Try to get some exercise every day, 30 minutes. Seek out friendships in person--maybe at the gym, or join a club or activity that you like. Stay in touch with healthy family members who truly love you, and try to spend no time at all with toxic family members who hurt you.

Many queer people would _prefer_ to not have to deal with all of the stigma, social backlash, and general hardships faced because of the way we were born. It's why you see so many teens _choose_ suicide instead of _choosing_ to be straight, because if sexual orientation truly were a choice, then even you could simply choose another sexual orientation right now.

It's quite literally life saving to affirm queer youth and let them know it's ok to simply exist, and I think it's great that schools like AISD are sharing that message with their students. No kids are killing themselves, or being disowned and forced to live on the streets at 14 because they're straight.

While we've been a bit quiet on Reddit lately, don't worry – we're still very much alive and kicking! We just took a short break over the holidays to let everyone enjoy some quality time with their loved ones or plan out those ambitious New Year's resolutions.  We've already had two fantastic meetups since the new year – And we're excited for more exciting strolls together!

  
First, I needed to let out some exciting news! Our most recent meetup was a hit, featuring over 20 gentlemen, with more than half being newcomers. This stroll took us from Wrigleyville all the way up through Roscoe Village!

  
For those unfamiliar, we are the [Chicago Gentlemen Who Stroll](https://www.instagram.com/chicago_gentlemenwhostroll/), a friendly group of guys who gather every other Sunday to explore and enjoy Chicago together. Our community welcomes a diverse range of individuals, from those new to the city to lifelong Chicagoans. If you're looking to make new friends, get out of the house, and be active on a Sunday, you're more than welcome to join us. Simply show up at the designated meetup spot at the scheduled time.  
I want to give a big shoutout to the [Chicago Girls Who Walk](https://www.instagram.com/chicagogirlswhowalk/), who inspired me to start this whole thing. They are soo massive they literally have people fly drones and follow the group.. its truly amazing. If you haven't heard of them, check them out!

  
We also have a vibrant [Discord](https://discord.gg/DqqWahbPPe) community with 200 active members. We use Discord not only to discuss upcoming strolls but also to socialize and plan smaller, more casual meetups, such as playing board games or attending concerts. If you're on Discord and looking to widen your social circle or, like me, start one, check us out.

  
While stroll information is on Discord, you can find all scheduled events on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chicagogirlswhowalk/), along with photos from our past strolls. Here's to 2024 and our growing community of Chicago Gentlemen Who Stroll!""",submission,Chicago,1.0

gnsstth,"As an aside, I do love how people tend to say ""so you're saying"" right before completely mischaracterizing another person's position. 

&gt;Cops have a right to kill people who are suicidal and are carrying a weapon?

ANYONE has the right to use deadly force to protect themselves or a 3rd party from imminent danger of death or grave personal injury. She was not merely ""carrying"" a blade. Through her words and actions she demonstrated intent to use the blade to cause death or severe injury. To carry means she merely had it in her possession. To display it in a manner that warrants alarm is obviously not the same thing.

[This is what a knife-wielding subject looking to commit suicide by cop looks like](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/07/03/17/15593280-0-image-a-26_1562169932049.jpg)

If you want an actual example of SPD killing a person for merely ""carrying"" a knife, that's John T. Williams. There's no excuse for that.

&gt;What good is a police force, a police force with millions of dollars at their disposal I might add, if they can’t unarm someone?

Great question. There's much issue being made about a lack of a taser. [Seattle PD's taser success rate is 60%](https://www.apmreports.org/episode/2019/05/09/when-tasers-fail). In a deadly-force encounter, using less than necessary force is often something done out of restraint. It can get you killed if you don't have the ability to follow up with deadly force immediately. 

&gt;Someone threatens to kill themselves and urges an officer to do so and the end result is the officer shooting, that’s assisted suicide, doesn’t make it right. 

You're right, it's horrible.

&gt;Doesn’t make it right that they shot and killed her in front of her kids.

Again, it's horrible. She should have been in a mental hospital, but the court didn't give a shit and let her go home off her meds. Is it the officer's fault for protecting their own lives or is it the fault of the larger system for allowing a person who is a danger to others on the street when she needs medication and treatment in a controlled environment?

&gt;You are arguing that it’s ok for cops to straight up execute people depending on circumstances.

No I am not. I'm stating the fact that you may protect your own life with deadly force when threatened with deadly force. 

&gt;I truly hope you never have to struggle with suicidal tendencies, that mentality is hard enough on anyone, without adding a shoot first police force approach.

Thanks for your well wishes. I've had enough people in my life suck start their personal firearms to know intimately about suicide. Had they received the care they needed and weren't left to their own, they might still be alive. Just likes Charleena Lyles.",comment,Seattle,1.0

cxvzk95,"During the Great Recession of 2008 the Federal Reserve made over $16.1 trillion dollars in secret loans to banks such as Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, Barclays, Bear Sterns, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and many others. In addition to $659.4 million in fees which they actually paid to the banks to help administer the loans. Meanwhile, they randomly decided to ""create"" $2.75 trillion new dollars and inject it in into the financial system. They're literally just typing numbers into a computer screen and making up money up that doesn't actually exist.

Our entire economy right now has been artificially manufactured by the Federal Reserve, and the major banks. Much like a Casino, they're just printing chips with no actually value to back them up. Worse yet they're then hoarding all of this ""money"" for themselves, and the 1% and they're using it to basically buy the entire country right now.

The Federal Reserve as we know it today is the result of a secret meeting that took place between bankers on Jekyll Island in 1910, and was signed into law in 1913 nearly 102 years ago. Just 20 years after its creation the Federal Reserve was directly responsible for the Great Depression, and nearly 70 years later caused the Great Recession of 2008. In fact, there has been 10 different economic recessions since the 1950's that can attributed to the Federal Reserve.

Now you're probably wondering why an entity that is supposed to prevent inflation and recessions would be doing purposely creating recessions? The answers do become a bit complicated, but ultimately it boils down to opportunity, corruption, and oppression. By controlling the flow of money, and keeping the economy on the edge of recession they are able to keep the majority of money in the hands of the 1% enabling them to maintain ownership and control of banks, Wall Street, corporations (monopolies), and even our politicians. Meanwhile, keeping everyone else enslaved to them through debt. It is a system of power, control, and slavery not much different then how a Casino is run.",comment,SanFrancisco,0.0

iiz9hwp,"There is a HUGE correlation between money spent and educational outcomes. Would you rather send your kid to the private schools the ultra rich send their kids to or a public school in the worst part of your state? Money matters.

You're right though, there is so much corruption that it undermines that. If you want to solve it with violence eventually than I would defend spending the money on a hip hop museum because schools aren't efficient. If you want to try to solve this without violence then I would start taking small steps to solve it that build up over time to create a better system and a ""new normal"" that is less corrupt.

I guess I'm trying to say that the REALITY here is that 5 million to schools would be a better investment that a hip hop museum, despite the corruption. On top of that, the possibility of that being a baby step is reason enough to do it on it's own.

It seems to me that the viewpoint you just expressed isn't a lot different from the viewpoint that took me from obese to morbidly obese. The depression mentality where you basically give up because the solution seems insurmountable. I understand it, but I think that we should either try to solve it the way I'm saying or we are forcing ourselves into solving it with violence and destruction.

To go with the analogy I wrote above, I think we should try to eat one less thing and see where that goes rather than giving up and then dealing with cancer, heart problems, etc. You have to start somewhere or resign yourself to a death spiral and the resulting chaos.

“An overwhelming majority, ranging between 81%-87%, does NOT view the following Palestinian violent acts as acts of terrorism: the assassination of the Israeli Minister Ze'evi by armed PFLP men, the shooting at Gilo in Jerusalem by armed Palestinians, the killing of 21 Israeli youths at the Dolphinarium club in Tel Aviv by a Palestinian suicide bomber, and the killing of 3 Israelis in Nahari in Israel at the hands of an Israeli Arab suicide bomber.”

“A March 2008 report by Palestinian Center for Policy & Survey Research (PSR) noted that the level of support for armed attack against Israeli civilians inside Israel increased significantly with 67% supporting and 31% opposed, compared to support by 40% in 2005 and 55% in 2006. A February 2008 suicide bombing that killed one Israeli woman in Dimona was supported by 77% and opposed by 19%.

An overwhelming majority of 84 percent supported the March 2008 Mercaz HaRav massacre, in which a Palestinian gunman killed eight students and wounded eleven in a Jerusalem school. Support for the attack was 91 percent in the Gaza Strip compared to 79 percent in the West Bank. Similar suicide attacks in 2005 had been less widely supported, with 29% support for a suicide attack that took place in Tel Aviv, and 37% support for another one in Beersheba.”

“A report by the Jerusalem Media and Communication Center, a Palestinian organization, showing trends based on polls conducted since 1997, indicated that Palestinian support for military, climbed to 65–85 percent in 2000–2004. ""Military operations"" were defined as including shootings, car bombs and mortar rocket attacks, but not suicide bombings.[142] A 2005 poll by the center indicated that 53 percent of Palestinians supported ""the continuation of [the] Al-Aqsa Intifada, 50 percent supported ""suicide bombings against Israeli civilians"", and 36 percent supported ""the resumption of military operations against Israeli targets"".

cq7v0sc,"&gt;Yes, the owners of Chick-fil-a have controversial views that go against the ""progressive"" mindset of the day.

They fund money directly from their business to controversial and at times ""tortuous"" anti-gay conversion therapies including electroshock therapy for ""curing"" gays. They don't fund these groups privately or personally, they choose to funnel money from their business directly into anti-gay conversion groups. They freely choose to associate ChikFilA and the Cathy name with these immoral conversion therapies.

It's not a ""view"" that goes against a ""progressive"" mindset. It's direct monetary contribution to barbaric ""medical"" procedures that are founded not in biology, medicine or an analysis of homosexuality, but rather firmly rooted in a bronze age religious concept _directly in spite of modern understanding_.

It's frustrating to see you push off this very-real thing as a ""having views that aren't progressive"".

Since when was not torturing people with electroshock therapy on purely religious grounds (and literally zero biological or medical basis) a ""progressive"" mindset??? Is it really ""progressive"" to say ""minors shouldn't be forced into bigoted conversion therapies that at times use torture and often perpetuate the LGBT teenage suicide epidemic""?

I can support people who think differently than me, but not people who use their time and money to literally attack and/or torture people who don't agree with them, and use their religion as an excuse to do it. 

It's not wrong to stand up and say ""We don't need to torture gay people with electroshock therapy against all biological and medical understanding!"" It wasn't our choice to associate the Cathy's with these tortures and suicides. It wasn't our choice to open their wallet in direct support of programs that lead teens to kill themselves out of self-hate and other sad outcomes of these therapies. It was their choice. This is freedom at it's best, they choose to support the immoral anti-gay conversion therapies with their business, brand and money. So, now their name is associated with these things.

 Do you understand what that word means? How exactly has a single thing I've said meant to illicit ""sympathy"" for myself?

Who gets to decide what exactly constitutes, ""mentally unwell""? Are substance abusers counted? Are people who suffer from depression? Can the definition of ""mentally unwell"" be changed by those who operate the program in the case of a political shift? How do you go about institutionalizing the nebulously, ""mentally unwell"" while avoiding restricting the rights of people who might just be a little odd?

All these questions y'all haven't answered and don't intend to answer are also irrelevant. *It is illegal and almost certainly immoral to incarcerate or institutionalize people who are not charged with a crime or who do not fit the strict definition (ie active and serious threat to themselves or others) necessary for non-compliant committal to mental health programs.*

 To suggest otherwise is to advocate for a very heavy-handed, deeply authoritarian, and very troubling management of society.

HOUSTON - A woman was killed Wednesday and a man is in critical condition after an attempted murder-suicide in downtown Houston.

Witnesses working on a nearby METRO rail told police they saw the couple arguing around 2 a.m. inside a car in the 1800 block of Rusk. They heard gunshots soon after, police said.

A security guard at the George R. Brown Convention Center said she saw the two arguing. When the woman turned toward her the man ""went crazy"" and pulled out a gun, the witness said. The witness ran away.  

No one else was inside the car, police said.

The woman, believed to be in her 20s, was killed. The man was taken to Ben Taub Hospital and is listed in critical condition.

Police are investigating the nature of the victim's relationship and what led to the shooting

I believe I only have two button-down white shirts, and while one looks nicer, especially untucked since it stops at waist height, this one has memories. I wore it on one of my last days in Costa Rica when I couldn't take feeling dirty anymore.Bruins women in Bruins kitchens at Bruins camp thought it was a shirt worthy of weddings, which I found mildy depressing as it's a fairly average, low thread count dress shirt. Anyway, that wasBruinsday of Bruinsobstacle course with Bruins mud pit, and despite taking Bruins shirt off well before Bruins event, Bruinsre's still a mud stain at Bruins bottom, just right of center. Mud is Bruins reason I'm wearing it now. Today we ""shadowed"" four pastors to get a sense of Bruinsir daily lives. To get to our pastor's house, (and while I'm thinking about it,Bruins""mini-barn"" that our group's Savings Group met at was actually a house) we drove downBruinsmain road ten minutes, at which point Bruins pastor, who had been waiting for us, got inBruinsSUV, Bruinsn fifteen minutes up a rough dirt mud road, across a few log bridges, one of which looked to be pieced togeBruinsr with wooden fence slats that made cracking sounds when we drove over it and definitely had a few missing pieces, that is, had holes, up to a point where we had to walk up slick red dirt. His house was atBruinsend of a ten-minute climb. Bruins pastor we were visiting was one of Bruins ones in my small group from yesterday. His name is John Peter, a good ol' two-parter first name. His neighbor, wife, son (about four years old) and infant daughter were Bruinsre with us. Shorty after arriving, his dad joined us. We sat in Bruinsir front room around a couple small tables of mismatched height.Bruinsroom was smaller than my tiny apartment kitchen. MoBruinsrs here are not at all shy about breast feeding. We talked for a while about his church. His congregation is fourteen people.BruinsAnglican Church, at least in Rwanda, feels instability reduces complacency, so he moves churches about once a year.Bruinsone he currently leads is a two hour walk from his home. He has to be at his church three days a week, and on off days, he walks downBruinshill to find pick-up jobs and/or do blacksmithing. Our translator, Ngoga, is some sort of liaison atBruinsnational level for World Relief Rwanda, and did some filling in to give our questions context. He also did his fair share of asking both parties his own, very helpful questions and Bruinsn translatedBruinsresponses. AsBruinspastor's wife, his wife isBruinspresident of his church's moBruinsring group and helps with encouraging women in Bruinsir marriages and resolving disputes. After about an hour, we went outside to look at his land. My apartment is pretty close to halfBruinssize of his entire property. In his garden, he has a couple banana trees, probably Bruinsre naturally, and has planted beans. He'll harvest about 30 kilos (do your own damn math), while he cooks about a kilo a day. Since he can't grow beans consistently, givenBruinsseasons, he can't come near to living off Bruinsm. Our translator, whom atBruinstime I only knew as our translator, gave him several different ideas on how he could more efficiently use his land. All he really said was, ""That's possible,"" nothing committal or excited. Lindsay, Christine, and I talked amongst ourselves asBruinspastor and Ngoga talked, about taking a soil sample, figuring out what would grow best Bruinsre, and buying seeds of something not native, and Bruinsrefore in low supply, to Rwanda. He could sell that crop for a high price inBruinsmarket due to being rare or exclusive. Bruinsre's a hot sauce on our dinner tables that is super spicy with no added flavor that I could discern.Bruinsfactory that makes it is only a short distance from his house, and is in constant need of peppers. Ngoga suggested he grow Bruinsse instead of beans, Bruinsn useBruinsprofits to buy beans or whatever else. Like I said, he didn't sound enthused. I have to admit, as frustrating as I find his attitude, I takeBruinssame one at my job. I'd raBruinsr deal with working aroundBruinsbugs than fix Bruinsm. We went back inside and minutes later it began to pour.Bruinsrain lasted a few minutes, Bruinsn began again, coming in waves. We ate lunch, it now being too rainy to safely get downBruinshill, and Bruinsre being no point in skipping lunch in order to beatBruinsrain forBruinssake ofBruinsdrive. Our meal was surprisingly American with ham sandwiches. Bruinsre was also passion fruit, which Lindsay bit right into, when it's more of a pomegranate experience, pine apple, and some sort of meat pie. We'd come with several aluminum sack lunches, but not quite enough for everyone inBruinsroom, as several neighbors had joined us. We made sure Bruinsy all got one before we did.Bruinsfour of us visitors sharedBruinsremaining two. Bruinsy asked us a few questions. One was wheBruinsr we have poor people in America. Bruinsy're always shocked that we do. We got to share about Bethany's Tabitha Ministry, a homeless women's shelter, and oBruinsr programs that serveBruinshomeless. When we'd finished our lunch, and it stopped raining, I prayed and BruinsnBruinspastor prayed, both translated.Bruinspastor, his wife, AnnaBruinsinfant strapped to her back, and his broBruinsr, walked us downBruinsnow slick and muddy hill to our SUV. It took quite a while, and atBruinsend, our shoes were coated withBruinsred, sticky mud.Bruinsjourney down, even with four-wheel drive, was still a bit terrifying. I don't usually get scared by things like this, and I didn't this time eiBruinsr, but it was definitely a dangerous trek, especially withBruinsrain that started back up a couple minutes before we made it toBruinscar. I'm surprised we didn't get stuck inBruinsmud. When we got back, we tried to figure out what to do with our shoes, clung to by mud as Bruinsy were. We tried to clean Bruinsm off in puddles or wiping Bruinsm in grass,Bruinseffect of which seemed to only be to colorBruinsground. When John got back with my room key, I washed Bruinsm off, Bruinsn showered, and changed into this white shirt. When I exitedBruinsroom, to head to our team time, a guy was collecting shoes to wash for us, mine now more wet than dirty. Maybe he has a hair dryer. OnBruinsbright side, we discovered we have a balcony, when looking for a place to put my wet shoes. We debriefed a bit as a team and with our translators who were all more than translators, hearing each oBruinsr's experiences, and asking questions about World Relief andBruinsculture of Rwanda. AllBruinsinformation was interesting and I'm sure important to someone, but I've always had a broken filter when it comes to judging importance, and can't recall much of it now. I remember that Ngoga said he lived 100 KM from here. I remember Richard sayingBruinsforeign aid fundBruinsUS put toward stopping/helpingBruinsAIDS epidemic in Africa is almost gone. I remember Josh Lyman repeating a statistic that 81% of Americans thinkBruinsforeign aid budget was too high and 72% think it should be cut, meaning that 9% of people are so bat shit out of Bruinsir minds that Bruinsy thinkBruinsforeign aid budget is too high and shouldn't be cut.Bruinsmajority of our team went out for coffee at Lava Java. I sacrificedBruinsexperience to journal (now) forBruinssake of you fine folks, and not because my only available shoes are dressy ones. I doubt Bruinsy'd have hot chocolate anyway. If I moved to London, I'd have to spell color with a u. Eww. Accents, right. Last night after our team time, a bunch of us went to play Nertz. When more people than decks arrived, we transitioned to Uno. Around 10:30 (totally just made that time up), Richard headed for bed, saying if three people were left, he'd play Nertz, obviously indicating himself, Lindsay, and me. We played one more round of Uno, Bruinsn dispersed. I went up to find him playing on his laptop hoping ""those Uno playing clowns"" would leave, allowing for his ""game of destiny"" or GOD, to commence. Well, at least he didn't come in last? I was slow at first but quickly gained momentum, slightly buffeted inBruinssecond to last round, making it a seven-point game betweenBruinstwo of us, Lindsay 10 points behind him.

Interesting history in light of this morning's most recent SPD sweep of city property at Cal Anderson and Miller Field. 

Patrick Kelly researched our city's persistent resident encampments of the 1930s for the U-Dub's [Great Depression in Washington Project](http://depts.washington.edu/depress/) under James Gregory, Chair of the UW's Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies. 

&gt;Here are the locations of eight shack towns that housed homeless people in the Seattle area in the 1930s. The largest, known as ""Hooverville,"" was on Elliot Bay near the present site of Qwest stadium. Click the markers to see photos and descriptions of each site. Click again to enlarge photos.

Of the largest of these, Hooverville, Kelly found:

&gt;Seattle's major Hooverville was located on Elliot Bay near the present site of Qwest Field. The first shacks appeared on this public land in 1931 but city authorities **ordered them burned. Residents rebuilt** and for the next ten years Seattle authorities tolerated the homeless community. The population may have exceeded 1,000 at some points in the 1930s. In 1941, the city burned the shacks to make way for new port facilities.

(Bolding is mine.) Prof. Gregory writes in his overview ""[Hoovervilles and Homelessness](http://depts.washington.edu/depress/hooverville.shtml)"": 

&gt;In Seattle shacks appeared in many locations in 1930 and 1931, but authorities usually destroyed them after neighbors complained.

One encampment in particular drew SPD's literally fiery repeated attention:

&gt;Seattle police twice burned the early Hooverville, but each time residents rebuilt. When a new mayor took office in 1932, owing his election in part to support of the Unemployed Citizen's League, Seattle's Hooverville gained a measure of official tolerance that allowed it to survive and grow.

and

&gt;Other Hoovervilles also developed: one on the side of Beacon Hill where today I-5 passes; one in the Interbay area next to where the city used to dump its garbage; and two others along 6th Avenue in South Seattle. In late 1935, the city Health Department estimated that 4,000 to 5,000 people were living in the various shacktowns.  
&gt;  
&gt;The city tolerated Hoovervilles until the eve of World War II. Early in 1941, the Seattle Health Department established a Shack Elimination Committee to identify unauthorized housing clusters and plan their removal. A survey located 1687 shacks in five substantial colonies and many smaller ones. In April, residents of the main Hooverville were given notice to leave by May 1. Police officers doused the little structures with kerosene and lit them as spectators watched. Seattle's Hooverville had lasted a full decade.

in Tacoma, Prof. Gregory notes:

&gt;Tacoma hosted a large encampment near the city garbage dump that residents called ""Hollywood-on-the-Tideflats."" By the end of the decade it covered a six block area and, like Seattle's Hooverville, included a large number of little houses that residents had built out of scrap materials and steadily improved over the years. City officials alternately tolerated and tried to eradicate the shack town. In May 1942, shortly after Seattle destroyed its Hooverville, the Tacoma Fire Department burned fifty of the ""Hollywood"" shacks. But residents rebuilt and the site remained occupied all the way through World War II.",submission,Seattle,1.0

es2ktan,"Therapist here, full-time practice in the Seattle area for 20+ years. A brief word of advice and explanation. Many clients need to find a therapist who takes their insurance because they don't have the money to pay out of pocket for their treatment. Understandable, but this causes a problem. Good therapists, especially very good ones, want to see as many patients as they can and make a decent living. Insurance drives down the hourly cost. 

For instance, I charge $200/hr private pay only; insurance wants to pay me $105 and send up the number of hours of paperwork etc that one must do for insurance companies to ensure that they are paying because they have to. So, if I allow 40 hours for my practice in a week and take insurance, I would see 20-24 patients and do at least 16 hours of paperwork (tedious!) for $2500/week. OR, I could see 40 patients a week, help twice the number of people, and make $4000/week with no tedious paperwork. No brainer, right? 

But wait! What about the clients who need help that can only afford their co-pay? Let's think about it differently for just a moment. If you are seriously depressed, anxious, etc, is it worth $10,000 over the course of a year to fix that and change your life? Of course. That's the same price as a 12 year old Subaru with 200K miles on it (using a Pacific Northwest touchstone here). PLUS, you can submit to your insurance company for reimbursement, often in the 50%+ range. Good therapists can work wonders in that time period, truly. 

In that same year, you may only pay $750 in co-pays to a therapist who has to take insurance (still building their practice, not enough previous client referrals, or referrals from other therapists/doctors, etc.), but you may not be much better off than you were at the beginning of the year (the reasoning being that if the therapist were very good, they wouldn't likely be taking insurance; not always true, but usually accurate). 

If you look at it from the perspective of someone who does not have any expendable income at all (as many don't), then they must use insurance, though I would suggest you try low cost/no cost agency resources like Eastside Catholic Services (you don't need to be Catholic, etc.). 

But the majority of people aren't realizing that for the same price that they are paying for eating out in a year, or buying a newer car, or a bigger apartment -- none of which are making them happy -- they might be able to engage a great therapist. It's no different than spending for a semester of higher education, etc, except that it can change your life. 

And this dynamic is in play in every major city with any kind of economic success -- not just Seattle. It's 10x truer in SF, NY, LA, etc. As a therapist, your top wage income is fixed (there are only so many hours you CAN work and only so high you can charge), so you have to be careful how you allow your time to be used in a high-end market.  

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Spending out of pocket can get you further, faster, and achieve your goals; may also be reimbursable by insurance. Seattle is not alone in this phenomenon.",comment,Seattle,1.0

fv8mma0,"I'm not saying this isn't shit and this isn't a major issue, but the real problem is with the government response to the virus.  The fed did not do enough to protect businesses, let alone critical hospitals and healthcare and this is what happens.  They found a way to bail out banks, airlines, car manufacturers, and a whole bunch of other moneymakers - why not hospitals?

Instead of doing real work to help businesses survive, the government lied about the threat and encouraged people to reopen.  Instead of doing things to help businesses survive (task forces, committees, meetings, cash, the list of things that should have been done is endless), the government said nope, no more money, no more assistance, guess you guys better open up or close for good.

Reopening isn't the problem.  Reopening too late isn't the problem.  Throttling the economy isn't the problem.  The lack of effective response created this problem.

Edit: Hell, just take a look at The New Deal.  During The Great Depression, the government kick started the economy by financing a massive amount of public works projects and putting as many unemployed people to work as they could.  Now look at the covid-19 era - nothing like that, not one bit.  Surely they could have figured out something better.

These situations are so tough because everyone involved is a victim. Getting assaulted by a stranger is terrifying, so is experiencing psychosis, so is watching your kid lose their mind. The good news is getting that guy to the hospital is a solution that helps everyone involved- but doing it requires knowledge of the mental healthcare system, community involvement and advocacy for someone who's basically impossible to be around- a lot of times from the very people they've traumatized.

I get that we need to have protections to keep people from getting committed unnecessarily, but the longer you let these illnesses go, the worse they get. And when there's any indication of violence, it can get really bad. I've known/talked to people who've killed their pets and badly injured and even killed family members (who they adored) during episodes- and became suicidal when they came to durring treatment. I've talked to people who genuinely believed people were trying to kill them or that they were being r*ped (which is a weirdly common delusion). One person tried to gouge out his eyeball because he thought people were reading his thoughts. And you can't get them help unless you're an expert negotiator or they start making serious threats. It's a nightmare.

evamoia,"&gt; You've made your opinion very clear. GFZs don't meet your goal.

It’s not simply my opinion - it’s fact.  Again, so maybe you get it this time, over 94% of mass shootings happen in GFZs.

&gt; On facts: Are you still against getting more?

If I thought there was a chance that this would actually gather more facts than I could support it.  But the simple fact is that this is an agenda driven waste of money that we already know will conclude that we need more laws and more ways to punish law abiding gun owners/make lawfully owing a gun more expensive and increase the risk of becoming a felon for no good reason.

It’s not intended to gather facts nor will it.  As such, it’s an inappropriate use of funds.

It’s made clear in the article:

&gt; With Democratic majorities in both houses, the state’s Legislature now has “elected officials who want to see action and not just ‘thoughts and prayers’ when we have these tragedies,” he said. **“Who sets the agenda really matters.”**

They have an agenda, they’re funding the agenda, and they will get the desired results - regardless of facts.

And as an expert in Public Health, I can say that I’m offended by the attempts to recast the issue of criminal gun violence as a “public health issue.”  It’s not.  

Even suicide is only loosely related to public health as it’s an individual impact not an issue that impacts the community at large (public) like water safety, restaurant safety, communicable diseases etc.  But even here we know the issue is that mental health services are inadequate.  We don’t need any more studies to tell us that.  We need to act on what we already know.",comment,Seattle,1.0

Households with cars/garages vs. those without? The list goes on. Whether a gun is in the equation or not, suicidal individuals are going to use whatever tools they have at their disposal to meet their means to an end. This has no bearing on the idea that because a firearm existed within reach, the individual was suddenly driven to suicide.

Especially when what’s the point? There’s so many similarities you really can’t make the “wrong” decision between MN and WA. So my commentary is just cursory, rather incomplete from a phone and unique to my own experiences but your mileage may vary. 

There truly are tradeoffs to literally everywhere. Nail down which factor(s) is MOST important to you. We all have our different priorities, preferences, personalities, etc.

I would say where you can get the best program at the best tuition value in the best COL. Assuming you’re in MSP now? UW is PRICEY and the regional living expenses are really high. I went to UMN undergrad and UW grad but had a research grant and stipend to eke by at that time and had very modest housing. But I also could have gone to UMN with in state tuition and obviously still had a fantastic education but saved SIGNIFICANT money overall. I mean I loved UW but now, more than ever, is it really necessary to take out additional loans..?? I guess unless you have a big scholarship or grant or something. You didn’t say which other institutions you’re considering though, but just stuff to think about.

I miss the Minneapolis Grand Rounds trails and parks systems! Truly a gem that I’m not sure any other city has anything like it. All the waterfront of allll the lakes and the Mississippi as public park space. Minneapolis is more bike-able in my opinion but that’s largely due to topography.

Around August through October is potential for fires that can produce such smoky skies and awful air quality for any length of time and it makes you feel like garbage. Sometimes the air is the worst AQ [in the world](https://www.nbcrightnow.com/news/seattle-hit-1-as-the-worst-major-city-in-air-quality-and-pollution-in-the/article_c0bc054e-f47b-11ea-ac6e-07fece1367b3.html)even. Which really bites big time because it comes during the only sunny months we have here lol ugh. Since summer “doesn’t start until July 5th.” Last year [2022](https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/seattles-air-quality-among-worst-world-second-day-row/T3LLXXLHYNFQ5D6C2Z4SGKHA7Q/)Sept-Oct were basically smoky for nearly those 2 full months from fires burning in the region and one bad one (human caused) in a forest camping area. Air purifiers always recommended out here.

This comes from intensely dry and hot summers that have been getting hotter to the point we had a deadly PNW [heat wave](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heat-wave-dome-2021-seattle-portland-weather/)in 2021 that caused Mt Rainier to lose snowpack (unheard of), roads buckled, businesses closed, people passed away…. It reached upwards of 115F in the Seattle and W WA region. That’s even scarier because the sun doesn’t fully set until like 9pm so it’s light out and staying hot till like 10. People BAKED in their apartments and houses, many witnessing their pets struggling. And barely half of Seattle area folks have A/C in their homes. Last year 2022 we broke records for days 90F and above

Seattle winters tolerability can vary among everyone of course. But I find them to be difficult. Did you know that Seattle is the [nation’s saddest most depressed city?](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.seattletimes.com%2Fseattle-news%2Fdata%2Fseattle-still-the-nations-saddest-large-metro-area-survey-shows%2F). Vitamin D, staying active, staying involved in a community, picking up new hobbies, layering up with good rain gear and getting outside, etc can all help. Winters are wet. Sometimes very wet. Sometimes snowy or icy then the metro revolves into chaos ha!! And it’s SO DARK. And it’s not only that there’s less hours of daylight, it’s that the skies are dark gloomy drizzly grey on top of that too. I find it to be overboard dark but that’s just me. I hate it lol. Winters can definitely be harsh in MN but I love how folks embrace it and there’s still festivals, events like Winter Carnival, Loppet, etc. There’s something so peaceful and rejuvenating about a cold evening with fresh snow and it’s just so quiet! And snowy sunny bluebird days. Seattle winters I just feel wet and drowsy.

I love the landscape and soo much water in the Seattle region. Along with MN, both cities are very water and nature based communities.

Both cities offer fantastic options for live music, fine arts, and visual arts.

Sometimes I feel like Seattle tries too hard to be different and edgy and elitist with so many things like the food scene, fashion, coffee, etc. where the local identity can get lost in pretense.

I love all the Asian food in Seattle but MSP also has a wealth of that. 

Yes Minneapolis has hiking too just not a big mountain range. That doesn’t mean there’s lot a wealth of outdoor activities.

I miss those balmy summer nights in MN where it stays warm in the evenings even when the sun sets and you can be outside with a tshirt sitting around outside.

Traffic can be insanity in Seattle/Puget sound with so much water and waterfront orientation. If one bridge is out it’s gridlock. 

The homeless, encampments and drugs issues here are **much** more amplified in Seattle. VERY heated issue. It’s been bad.

“Seattle Freeze” and “Minnesota Nice” get bad rap. Join clubs, classes and groups, volunteer, do the activities and hobbies you like to do around people that also like them. Being in a collegiate program should help with networking. Don’t expect immediate best friends, it can take some time as oftentimes people are just focused on their own sphere. And being polite and not intrusive shouldn’t be interpreted as “rude” or “cold.” I also don’t believe that all people either introvert OR extrovert. Many of us fall in the middle. I do feel like Minnesotans are warmer though. Although I grew up there I was still forging new friendships all the time. Feels like Seattle has definitely been more difficult though to do so. More skeptical of people initiating conversation, more flaky, stressed seeming? Also the geography can complicated things: say you live in Sand Point and your friends live in West Seattle - that’s definitely a quarrelsome trip to make haha. 

The Puget Sound ferry system is super neat and an awesome resource. 

Both metros have strong economies with multiple large companies based there.

Both metros have major league sports.

Both metros have decent to good transit accessibility.

[MSP airport](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/msp-airport-named-best-airport-in-north-america/) is ranked best airport in N America! And is centralized so you’re able to fly to either coast or connect internationally with ease.

It's dark, wet, and generally pretty depressing from about November until April, and sometimes longer depending on the year.  The cost of living has skyrocketed, which is an issue in itself, but the main consequence of that is the homelessness problem. There are LOTS of vagrants and drug addicts wandering the streets of the city, with more showing up every day. The city leadership seems to be completely hopeless in their efforts to tackle that one. Everything they do seems to only make it worse.  Personally, I find the poltical/social climate in Seattle detestable.

It speaks to increasing polarization, and that there was very little offered by Trump that is relevant to city voters.

I would also be interested to see in heavily red areas how this appeared.   As rural areas are by definition for more spread out, it's difficult to find one to do a set 1:1 comparison with that couldn't just be waived off as irrelevant.  I would expect the vote for Hillary was depressed a lot in heavily red areas as well.

But in either case, this doesn't come off to me anyway with the tone implied here.  Only getting 8% of a groups vote is relevant.   Hyperpolarization also means that this area has very little to offer Trump, as compared to the swing states that got him elected.   There's very little incentive for him to moderate his positions on our immigration stances... and given the fact that the people he wants to put in charge of drug policy are anti-marijuana, maintaining the implied threat of federal raids on our dispensaries would also harm us.  Even a single raid actually carried out with whatever justifications they wanted to use would be enough to destroy the industry... properly spun he could convince people that he's still neutral on marijuana, but that they had to for whatever reason just once.  That makes the implied threat have teeth while still doing the damage.

History has shown that he has a bit of a vindictive streak, and if he decides he wants to make an example out of California and Washington there is a lot of damage he could do.

9dyro7,"Is it possible to evict someone due to not doing chores/fucking up chores? I have a roommate, we'll call her stovetop seeing as how she has tried to gaslight me so many times since living here. In the 4 months that stovetop has lived here, she has taken out the recycling a total of 2 times, washed dishes 1 time, claims to have cleaned the toilet once, but definitely has not. This morning, I had to dig out of the compost bin for the 4th-5th time, plastic bags with rotten food in them because stovetop is too baked to remember to take the fruit and veggies out of the bag, before it goes into the compost. I brought it up to stovetop, and stovetop claims she only put the bag in there once (so if she knew it was in there, why didn't she take it out?). Never at any time, has stovetop vacuumed, mopped, taken out the compost or any other chore that needs to be done around here. We also share things like toilet paper, trash bags, dish soap and common household things like that, never have I met someone so cheap, as to buy 1 ply toilet paper and in the smallest package available when the rest of us buy the good shit and in 12 packs or greater. Nevermind the fact that stovetop often leaves food wrappers and spills on the counters in the kitchen every time they cook and never cleans it up, as an aspiring chef, my kitchen is my safe place.

I understand having depression, I have it myself, as well as PTSD, OCD and anxiety. I also smoke cannabis. I do not let these things deter me from being a responsible adult when I have to be, so she really has no excuse for this, especially when it's been discussed and denied by her that it's even happening until I bring up proof to her, and then her words all of the sudden change. I don't want to live with someone like this, and my other roommate doesn't either. Our landlord lives in the same building, I've been here the longest and all I have to do is give the word to my landlord and he'll give the notice because I have been a very loyal tenant since the beginning and this isn't the 1st time we've dealt with people like this living here. However, I really want to know the legality of it all, because eventually, someone is going to attempt to fight it and I want to know if that's even possible.

iusai4h,"I quit as a lifeline volunteer around this time this switchover happened. 988 uses your area code to figure out where to connect you. If you have a 617 area code, you'll likely get connected with Samaritans a Boston based organization that mans the hotline using volunteers. I never really got a proper opportunity to vent about my experience, so why not vent here on Reddit! 

I have mixed feelings about Samaritans and lines like these. Partially because of Samaritans and partially because of how lines like these generally work. Before COVID (and before my time), Samaritans had a call center in Boston where you could be together with other call takers and have time between calls to chat with and support each other. When I was a volunteer I just did it from home in total isolation. I was in a Zoom class for training and then never really met any of my fellow volunteers again (not that I really got to know anybody in the Zoom class). 

I complained about this multiple times and they didn't really have a solution or a plan. Samaritans was too busy being proud about how now that the work could be done remotely they had volunteers in London and India! You are required not talk to anybody but fellow volunteers about the calls you hear. But when you're doing it remotely, you don't have know any volunteers. I could request calls with my supervisor who I also didn't know if I wanted to talk about this stuff with. It's a lot to carry around with no real support system. When I decided to quit, I had zero personal connections to the organization and didn't even have a trusted resource there to complain to. All they gave me was a really short 4 question Google Forms survey.

Additionally, most of the callers we got were NOT suicidal. A large proportion of them were frequent callers who called multiple times a day. A lot of these people had burned all the bridges in their life and liked talking to us because we had a policy of giving no advice and never saying anything judgmental to them. By the end of my tenure, I didn't feel like I was helping these folks. Is it truly helpful to be non-judgmental with someone who is telling me how they don't listen to their doctors, therapists, family, or friends and how THEY are in the right and everybody else is wrong? Unlikely. Honestly, I found the calls with people who were actually suicidal much easier to deal with as I could actually give advice in that situation and they weren't calling me each shift telling me the same things over and over again. I am glad I was there to listen to THOSE folks.

At the end of the day, Samaritans having no volunteer community and the model itself were too much. I wouldn't recommend volunteering with Samaritans. Unless a caller is actively suicidal, there is very little you can do to help someone. Instead, much of your time will be eaten up by listening to non-suicidal people who have severe mental illnesses and can be very difficult to listen to. And you'll have no support while do you it.",comment,Boston,1.0

I am a unemployed graphic designer and programmer who, until recently, was raising my infant son. My fiancee has been suffering some severe post-partum depression and suddenly decided that she had too many issues with her life and can not handle being in a relationship right now. So she threw me out the house with no money, no place to go, and to top it all off, she even shut off my phone service!

So I am stranded right now, penniless, and homeless. I am not usually one to go looking for hand-outs, but if there is anyone here who might be able to help me out in any way, shape or form, I'd be so incredibly grateful. I'd be happy to take on any type of work someone might have, whether it's pulling weeds, cleaning gutters, writing code, or designing a website.

I am a very kind, considerate and down-to-earth guy who could really use a helping hand right now, be it a little bit of work thrown my way, a couch to surf or tent in a backyard to sleep in, or just a cup of coffee and someone willing to listen. I promise that I am not crazy or anything, just kind of hurting right now and could really use a friend.

Like I said, my phone service is shut off, and the only way I can check my this thread or my email is at the library (where I'm at now), or when I can catch an open wireless signal with my phone. I am in Pierce County right now, and someone gave me bus fare to come into Seattle where the only shelters in the area are. I should be in the city between 7-8pm tonight.

dwjweg7,"I am aware I haven't proposed anything, because I also believe that an outright ban is a bad idea.  You've brought up a gun ban all on your own.  All I've been doing is rebutting the idea that gun legislation can't reduce the amount of gun death and violence.

I'm not an expert, but if you want me to propose something, here's what I'd like to see:

Increase regulations around gun ownership, federally.  Don't ban any particular weapon: everything that's currently legal stays legal.  Just make it so people have go through training, get a license, be registered in a database, buy a protective safe, if they want a gun. Not too different than if you want to drive a car (metal death machine's that are regulated, to great effect).  I'd love if it were as hard to get a gun in the US as in Japan or Australia ([How to buy a gun in 15 countries](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/02/world/international-gun-laws.html)).

Anyone who does not want to comply with the new regulations can sell their weapon back to the government at market price.  It's called a buyback.  It's not a ""seizure"", and everyone who wants to keep their gun has every right to do so. The ones that refuse to comply with the new regulations risk violating the law.  This would reduce the number of guns available, which is [the only factor that can predict how many mass shootings a country will experience](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/americas/mass-shootings-us-international.html).

Increased regulation and a buyback isn't a crazy fantasy situation that will never happen.  What I'm describing is exactly what Australia did after a mass shooting in 1996.  Since then, they have not had any mass shootings, and the number of guns in the country reduced dramatically.  Is there still gun violence? Of course. Do people still die from guns? Of course.  Do people commit suicide via other means? Of course.  Does that mean Australia would be better of repealing the law? No, of course not.  Because it doesn't make sense to talk about this in absolutes.

I do not have any solutions that I think will reduce the gang violence in Chicago in the short term.  That's an extremely tough nut to crack. I think having a buyback to reduce the number of guns available might have an effect, but I don't know.

So let's start with the easy stuff: mass shootings and suicides. Both of these can be addressed by regulating guns the same we do cars.  We can't stop every mass shooting or suicide, but we can make it less likely that they will occur.",comment,Chicago,1.0

cntxwb,"Anyone in the Bay feel the same...? Man.. I feel like I'm losing it..

About a week ago, I was (unethically) let go from my sales job. With literally no warning, I was told I had 3 days to hit an arbitrary number on an arbitrary date or I would be terminated. To say I was blindsided would be a massive understatement - considering I had been outperforming many people who started around the same time.

Which brings me to where I am now - at a cafe, trying to find the focus and motivation to get me to better my situation. But there's one glaring problem that has been following me for the last decade... anxiety, low self image, and overall lack of direction in my life.. There are times I shine and am looked at for who I am - a very compassionate, outgoing guy - but much of that is hard to uncover on a consistent basis.

I recently turned 30, and all these problems I've been numbing &amp; self-medicating with drugs and alcohol are now center stage in my life... I find myself spinning in circles, reading journals from 2013 that radiate the same struggles I'm going through now, and I'm to a point where I can't keep living like this... My ADHD (or at least the symptoms of that) are the kerosine that fuel my mounting levels of overwhelm.

When I was around 20-21, my parents got divorced, my entire friend group disbanded over petty drama, and my then girlfriend at the time decided it would be best to screw another dude, which left me devastatingly heartbroken.. My life essentially fell apart in rapid succession, which sparked an identity crisis that would last a decade.

I turned into a self-help junkie, trying to intellectualize my way out of this situation.. but I find myself stuck in neutral. Old patterns and routines keeping me locked in this toxic orbit that I can't seem to break free from.

Which brings me to the point of this novel... Is anyone else in a similar situation? Has anyone found a way to make it through the other side of your anxiety and depression? I feel so isolated, and all I want is to correct this corse that I'm on so that I can finally start living.. I would be so grateful if someone could give me some advice on these things:

1.) Best way to find new things to do/people to meet (I've looked on [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) and I'm sure there's good stuff there, but if anyone has specific groups to join, that would be awesome!)

2.) Maybe a story of how you made it through the other side

3.) Best place to meet new people/ best ways to find local events that are going on

4.) Online communities to connect with more people 

Honestly, I don't think I did the best job writing this post. I haven't written in awhile, and I barely know what the hell I'm looking to accomplish with this... But I just feel like there has to be other people out there in the Bay Area who are struggling.. 

Something I’ve been thinking about involves creating a group where people in a similar situation to this can get together and help each other be more accountable, so if that is something you're interested in, let me know and let's make it happen! I have nothing but time... and would love to meet more like minded people in the bay area.

Thanks for reading :) Hopefully my next post will be more coherent.

P.s - If anyone is interested in starting an accountability group or anything of that nature, shoot me a message!

Edit: This is my first post, and I have to say that I’m very grateful for all of you who responded! It really makes me happy to know there’s good people like you out there. 

There’s some big points I left out that would have painted a better, full picture, like the fact that not only have I gone to therapy, I’ve studied CBT at length (which means little if not applied), and have a very big outgoing personality that can light up a room ONLY when these issues are not present.. which isn’t 100% of the time. It’s crippling symptoms to me at times, but I’m still generally looked at as a reasonably happy, very outgoing person. It’s just this weird stuck feeling..

Spanish dolphin trainer Jose Luis Barbero was found dead inside his vehicle in the public parking lot of the Palma de Mallorca airport, a source with the Spanish National Police tells CNN.

Authorities say the case is being treated as a suicide. 

Barbero disappeared earlier this week, just two days before another troubling video showed up online.

dpcfff2,"&gt;So I as understand it, you think the 2008 recession was caused by the government

Yes. The seed that the whole situation sprang from was planted by government meddling creating perverse incentives. 

&gt;That's like saying a person died from morbid obesity because the doctor messed up.

It's more like saying a patient died from a botched surgery. 

&gt;The recession issue popped up because we just happened to be discussing it, why can't we discuss a particular detail? 

We can, but I don't see how it scores any points for your side when what you want would produce far, far worse results economically than an occasional up and down.

&gt;Do you have any proof that non capitalist countries wouldn't succumb to depressions? How do economies without ideologies that perpetuate infinite growth, even though it isn't theoretically possible, succumb to depressions?

The current level of economic activity is only supported by capital and credit. Take either or both of those away, and the amount of economic activity would plummet dramatically. With no capital, business would crumble, production would disappear, and personal wealth would disappear. It would be a devastating depression. 

&gt;They are not entirely capitalist free, but the socialist Scandinavian countries are doing fine, even better than all capitalist countries today. 

Capitalist with social programs != socialist. There is absolutely nothing socialist about Scandinavian countries. Their success has nothing to do with workers owning the means of production.

No, because the credit and capital still flow freely.

Ignoring the needs of American citizens, while prioritizing the needs of illegal immigrants because they represent your political strategy for the future (i.e., the theoretical voting block to get you a permanent majority), exhibits such an inverted sense of priorities; it's preposterous.

American citizens in Texas, like in the Rio Grande Valley and parts of Dallas and Houston need better schools and teachers.  Veterans are committing suicide at a higher rate than they're killed in combat. Why are illegal aliens higher priority to you than veterans who fought for this country?

kwotr28,"How a ‘murder’ in Boston that didn’t happen made national news in India

Numerous media outlets in India have reported that 20-year-old Abhijeeth Paruchuru was killed and his body was dumped in a forest in Boston. The reality is different.

By Anjana Sankar    Updated March 26, 2024, 3:00 a.m.

The death of a young Indian student in Massachusetts has fueled a storm of online outrage and misinformation in his native country, where lurid headlines have baselessly suggested he was murdered in Boston as part of a rising tide of anti-Indian violence in the United States.

University of Massachusetts Dartmouth student Abhijeeth Paruchuru, 20, was found dead in a car in Freetown on March 8. Massachusetts authorities believe he died by suicide. “We found significant evidence indicating that he took his own life,” Dave Procopio, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts State Police, said in an email.

“We’re investigating it as an apparent suicide and waiting to hear from the medical examiner,” Gregg Miliote, a spokesperson for the Bristol County District Attorney’s Office, told the Globe.

But a far different story about Paruchuru’s death — with details that in some cases are obviously false or implausible — is being told by some of the largest news sources in India.

Numerous outlets there have run stories describing Paruchuru as a Boston University engineering student whose body was found in a forest on the campus and claimed that his family alleges he was murdered. The Times of India reported on X last week that he “was murdered.”

Several “assailants” were involved, one report said. The student might have been killed “for money and his laptop,” said another, or maybe in a personal dispute. “Brutally murdered in America,” said another.

Those news reports have heightened fears for the safety of Indian students in the United States, following other reports of violence against Indians — some of which genuinely occurred; others appear to have also been exaggerated or mischaracterized in the Indian press.

Earlier this month, Amarnath Ghosh, a 34-year old dancer and master’s student at Washington University was shot dead in St. Louis. Vivek Saini, a 25-year-old Indian who had recently completed a degree, was killed in Georgia.

But a student at Purdue University who was included in media lists of students “attacked” in the United States this year also died by suicide, according to the the coroner’s office in Warren County, Ind. Another listed as “attacked” died of asphyxia “with cold exposure and ethanol intoxication as other contributing factors.”

Safety concerns for Indian students are a significant issue in India, particularly given that the United States is the most preferred destination for higher education among Indians, with nearly 270,000 enrolled in the 2022-2023 academic year alone.

India’s media landscape is huge and freewheeling — with editorial standards that often vary dramatically. Violence in the United States is certainly a legitimate concern, but the hyperbolic coverage in India is creating an exaggerated impression of the dangers.

The accounts that circulated in Indian media about Paruchuru’s supposed killing in Boston were “fictitious,” though, according to Mariellen Burns, a spokesperson for the Boston Police Department. Colin Riley, a spokesperson for BU, said Paruchuru was not a student at the school. BU also does not have a forest on its campus.

The Indian consulate in New York — while still mistakenly describing Paruchuru as a student in Boston — did take a step to correct the record this week, posting on X that the “initial investigations rule out foul play.”


But accounts insinuating that Paruchuru was murdered continue to circulate in India — and continue to stir outrage.

“This is so depressing and scary,” commented a reader on Facebook.

“US is no longer safe for Indian students!!” commented another.

“Very tragic. No one seems to bother over these continuous attacks on Indian students,” another reacted.

Paruchuru lived in South Windsor, Conn., before attending UMass Dartmouth. An uncle who said he could speak to the Globe on behalf of the family, Tarani Paruchuri, who also lives in Connecticut, said the family is upset by media reports stating that Paruchuru was murdered.

Paruchuru’s family relocated to the United States when he was 10, according to Paruchuri. He was a “well-behaved child” who did not argue with his parents even as a teenager, said the uncle. “He was not very outgoing, did not have many friends. Online gaming was his main hobby.”

Paruchuru was studying Computer & Information Science at UMass Dartmouth, according to an email sent to the UMass Dartmouth community after his death. He was the only child of Chakradhar Paruchuri and Srilakshmi Boruna from the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

gsozbj3,"Not in LA at scale. as the original reply mentioned, there's still 1950s / McCarthy era laws on the books that make it much more difficult to build public housing in LA and California compared to elsewhere in the country. Existing public units have incredible wait-lists and are more geared towards working families over people who need additional support. There's not currently a robust public housing program anywhere in the US afaik beyond maintaining past construction, as our Dept of Housing and Urban Development was defunded in the 80s and 90s.

LA city's voters passed a measure to fund transitional shelters in 2018 called Proposition HHH, but they've been unable to complete almost anything due to a combination of cost overruns and neighborhood opposition. The federal government has offered to fully fund hotel or rental bookings for shelter during the pandemic since Biden took office, but our city council doesn't plan to use the money after the early-2020 Project Roomkey plan fell extremely short of its goals. Our vacancy rate has increased dramatically enough since then that housing people in hotels or existing private units could be a solution, but the only recent shift in city policy has been to make it easier for single family homeowners to add smaller units to their properties

Honestly the OP is depressingly short sighted because ""clearing the tents"" was handled in the least effective, most violent way possible - nobody at all is allowed in the park, there's an ugly construction fence around it, the ""offer of services"" made to park residents was last minute and didn't involve anything permanent, and nearly 200 people were arrested by riot police during a protest at the local council members office as the park was closed off. Including at least 11 reporters, compared to 19 arrested by LAPD throughout 2020, it's all very ominous to how the city will treat any protest or dissent this year.

Lovers of today is a fun little 'speakeasy' underneath Niagra (don't recommend this place), accessible on 7th street around the corner. Candle-lit and intimate, nice spot. 

7B/horseshoe is a good sports dive on ave B if thats what you're into. Also B-side up the street is pretty sweet. Barebones bar with cheap drinks and good music. 

Doc holidays or Manitoba's are good for a true East Village dive. I actually met my wife at Manitoba's whilst eating 2 BECs and drinking tall Natty Ice's. 

Essentially all these places play classic rock/dive rock so you're fine in the music department, nor do they tend to get insane busy, with Ace bar probably being the only exception.

My favorite bar in NYC and maybe the world is Coal Yard on 1st av, but no one likes that place and I would prefer to keep it that way. Bartenders are the best, drinks are cheap, bar is U shaped, music is fantastic and never gets busy. The place does reek of alcoholism and depression but that's my kinda flavor.

g044rg0,"Van Gogh was certainly a pauper when he passed, but his work was appreciated by his contemporaries (Gauguin comes to mind). 

The most amazing thing about Van Gogh, IMO, was that just sister-in-law, Johanna Van Gogh-Bonger, was mostly responsible for his work becoming known at all. 

Her husband Theo (an art dealer) inherited all Vincent’s work after Vincent’s suicide in 1890.  A year later Theo died of syphilis leaving her and their infant son alone.  She later remarried (an artist) and by maintaining Theo’s contacts in the art world she helped to build the story of Vincent’s tragic life.  She collected, edited &amp;amp; published several volumes of letters between Theo &amp;amp; Vincent.  By the late 1900s (the decade) there was growing interest in Vincent &amp;amp; his work. 

She collaborated with German publishers &amp;amp; gallery owners and put on a show of Vincent’s work in Berlin in 1914.  The rest is history.",comment,Chicago,1.0

The person in question is elderly and it used to be that at least the consequences of old age might slow them down—too hard to get to the casino, track, whatever with regularity. But with online sports betting (in conjunction with boredom/loneliness), forget about it. It’s fucking awful. There’s a reason gambling has the highest suicide rate of all addictions - the economic consequences can ripple through generations in a way that even drugs generally doesn’t cause.

This leads to anxiety, depression, and a loss of control.  This is exacerbated by current threats being outside of our ability to resolve: at best we can continuously lower our risk of catching a potentially-fatal condition.

e6ojdki,"&gt;To be certain, a single year does not make a trend. The low number for 2017 could turn out to be a fluke. Perhaps the weather was a factor — we had the wettest start to a year on record in 2017, and that surely depressed the bike-commuting numbers to some degree, at least through April.

&gt; ...

&gt;When Seattle does build bike infrastructure, people use it.

&gt;Dongho Chang, the Seattle Department of Transportation’s (SDOT) chief traffic engineer, points to the Second Avenue protected bike lane as an example. The lane was extended through Belltown to Denny Way in February.

&gt;“(It) saw a 31-percent increase in ridership compared to last year, and is expected to draw more riders with the new extension to Denny and the impending connections to Pike and Pine,” he said in an email.

&gt;Despite the dip in last year’s numbers, Seattle still ranks fifth for bike commuting among the 50 most populous U.S. cities, unchanged from 2016. Portland, where 6.3 percent of workers ride bikes, remains the No. 1 city, as it has every year this decade. The Rose City had nearly 23,000 bike commuters in 2017.

Evil and cruel is saying things like, ""Your family would be better off without your dumbass. Go fucking k\*ll yourself.

Peaceful protests don't get attention, rioting protests do. Look it up. That's how the labor movement made progress, that's how gay people achieved rights. This is how the world works. If peaceful protests got attention, lots of people would go that route. But nobody gives a fuck if you're protesting peacefully. They care when you hit them where it hurts - their businesses, their money.

dxn19wh,"&gt; I survived because of tough love

It sounds like you survived because of love **bolstered by the resources your parents made available to you**. Seems like you had a roof over your head and meals too, not to mention the baseline emotional support that comes with a couple that's willing to pay the high costs of a rehab treatment course. 

The folks in this thread aren't interested in providing the homeless with a roof over their head -- unless it's in a prison cell. They're not interested in ponying up the resources needed to genuinely support these people. When they upvote your talk of ""forced rehab"" they're not focusing on the pieces of the equation that help keep a person clean by helping them create a *reason* to stay clean, they're cheering any idea that *puts the homeless in a place they can't see them*.

I'm glad your work allows you a route to support the realization of your political convictions; I assure you mine does too. But that doesn't make what you're advocating in this thread good policy vis a vis drug-addicted homeless persons. So maybe you believe in more than forced rehab; maybe you also believe in providing the other requisite services the homeless need to have any real chance at escaping that status -- but look around this thread! Look around this subreddit! Look at the *dehumanization* of the homeless, the utter *contempt* for the homeless. I repeat: people around here don't give a fuck about the wellbeing of homeless persons, they just don't want to have to see it. And yes, *that* is indeed gross. (And so is shit on the streets, sure.

Speaking as someone who was very ""eh"" about *Seattle is Dying*, the second entry actually felt pleasantly palatable.

What I appreciated here is that there were actual solutions proposed that were not only worth talking about/considering, but also very liberal, such as their coined ""Hope Haven"". It wasn't some Jason Rantz ""sEaTtle baD!"" bullshit, it seemed more geared to illicit discussion and *provide solutions* (wow, misleading post, shocker).

Look, you can feel how you want about KOMO, but when people ignore the content and go straight for the publisher, it should probably make it clear that they weren't able to come up with any substantive criticisms.

This second entry also does a solid job giving voices to those who seldom have one. At one point they covered the suicide death of Kevan Carter Jr, a black man and local artist who begged for mental health treatment from our psych wards and was sent home each time. It did so without even *mentioning* homelessness, instead simply allowing the viewer to see how broken our system is from the words of Carter's family.

Also speaking was the family of Lorenzo Anderson, a 19-year-old black teen who was shot and killed during an unfortunate night of CHOP. Moreover, you hear from our homeless, our poorest, our mentally ill, our addicted, etc.

Many other interviews from those on the fringes of society were present. Skip every produced scene, mute the narrator if you need to, but watch those interviews. They provide wonderful insight, and if you really care about black lives and in general the lives of our most marginalized members, at least listen to what they have to say.

In Jazz’s case especially since she switched to taking estrogen, yes she did not go through male puberty. In the world of trans medicine (as backed up by WPATH and the AMA) this would be a success. Obviously if you continue to take puberty blockers long term into your 20s you wouldn’t resume puberty, but that is just not how they are prescribed for trans or questioning children. They are used as a stop gap to pause puberty for a year or two until the patient is able to make an informed decision to transition or not. 

Ultimately though these conversations aren’t even public interest. Being trans and transitioning are personal medical issues that should be dealt with privately with a doctor and the public should have absolutely no say over whatsoever. I’m sorry you think it’s gross or weird or whatever, but transition is important and saves lives. Right now about 40% of trans youth attempt suicide when they do not have access to care or social support. For me personally this includes family members and friends who have killed themselves over the lack of access to medical care that you support. When treated appropriately and allowed to transition the suicide rate is the same for trans youth as their cis peers.

I'm really really glad he had someone he felt he could trust enough to share his plans for suicide with - that in itself is a help-seeking behavior. Please feel free to PM me if you would like any other support/resources - for someone experiencing suicidal ideation with detailed plans, the hospital's discharge plan will almost certainly include a referral for outpatient services. I hope that he is able to accept the support.

And also wanted to say, it's okay to be scared and hopeful. I have \~15 teenagers on my caseload, nearly all who have extensive histories of suicide attempts prior to treatment in this (outpatient) program. I am one year into being the primary therapist with our program, and while a couple of people have needed a brief hospitalization over the course of the year, the majority have been doing quite well at home, in their community. It can be really terrifying to let go of the fear around discussing suicide - I know sometimes people worry that mentioning suicide will re-trigger someone's ideations, but I promise it doesn't.

I ""run"" the meetup now because it really brought happiness and friends to my life after college.  I didn't have a great group of friends so I was generally depressed.  I came across the local reddit meetup about 4+ years ago and it's really changed my life.  I recommend it to anyone looking to make some new friends.

but, to answer your question... It would be a fucking nightmare right?  you're describing a situation where the prices are dropping but folks _still_ wont buy _anything_.   Not just beef, but all things used to measure inflation.  

deflation happens because people dont physically have money to buy things.   the prices are keen but you cant earn any money to buy stuff.  all your savings are gone, your broke, and you cant find a job.

gyy966r,"I definitely agree that compassion is necessary for proper discourse, I've just been seeing an obscene lack of it the past 5 years or so, even outside of the realm of politics, and IRL. It's pretty depressing honestly.

I would tend to agree with you on the restricting local governments/schools thing too, however, in this case, given the purpose of the mandate, I don't think it's actually a health issue, in the context of the purpose of the mandate...

Because of the numbers we have, in particular in a huge city like Houston, I don't think that if an area became a hotspot it could overwhelm all of the hospitals reasonably in range. Even if a few hospitals reached capacity, (which I think is very unlikely at this point) this isn't something where moving patients to other hospitals would be dangerous... So, since it isn't likely that the hospital system as a whole would be unable to care for covid patients in the event that a local area got really bad, is not reasonable to say local governments still have a justification to be in a state of emergency about this.

So I still don't think it was hypocritical, given that framework. Now that said, I typically prefer government to be as limited and localized as practical while still providing the needs of the people, so I would greatly prefer local governments and schools to be able to decide what's best for their area.

On the other hand, several studies have shown that children are at a much lower risk, and my friend with a degree in early child development and my friends in teaching and after-school daycare, including a director and her assistant, are all very concerned about how masks are effecting children's social development. Not being able to see the majority of the expressive facial features on almost everyone they encounter for over a year is absolutely going to have an impact on their development and their ability to pick up on social cues, and probably a very dramatic effect. Couple that with the lost part of the last school year and the absolute ineffectiveness of the vast majority of distance learning and this is going to be an severely stunted generation... 

Unfortunately, there is so much fear about covid in certain communities, that places continuing to require masks past the point science says we don't need to require them are a certainty. That and the above analysis about schools and masks really make me think the ban on requiring masks in schools may be what's best for the kids, even if it's not what best for the health of everyone. (Since kids can still spread it even though they are very low risk.) So I'm on the fence about whether I think it's the right call to make. Do what's best for the kids, at the risk of spreading to everyone else a little more and restricting local governments ability to govern, or do what's best for society as a whole, at the further expense of our children...",comment,Houston,1.0

It was so quiet because no cars were on the road. We kids were playing outside and it was gorgeous. The storm was over of course, and the sun had crusted up the top of the snow. I ran on the top of it but my siblings were heavy enough to fall through, so they struggled to move around. We made huge slides. Then one person from down the road came cross-country skiing down the middle of the road and asked how we were doing. He said that there was no power yet in the two nearest test town centers. Since cars couldn't get out and there was no power, so no TV news, he decided to check everything out on his skis to report back, and see if anyone needed help.

f2cdns9,"I basically agree with all that. Wasn't expecting a mini-essay.

I have a chronic illness that was so bad before I was treated that I could not work, plain and simple. It just hurt too much.

My medication cost $5500 a month without insurance. Most of the time insurance is provided by work.

My point here is that without already having some money + the financial and emotional support of my family, there's no doubt in my mind that I'd have been homeless and damn-near crippled. Basically I was lucky where others are not and for some there is no one who's going to catch them. My family helped me cope mentally and pay for an ACA plan (along with the feds/state of CA which supplied some subsidy for said ACA plan making it somewhat affordable). However the help of the state would never have been enough alone, and in TX the policies towards the poor and/or disabled are far more brutal than CA.

I guess that's just a little anecdote about how easy it is to fall through the cracks, and something as simple as where you're born, where you live, and who your parents are mean everything.

On loneliness - also totally agree. Went through an awful phase of it myself. I tend to think that mass/school shootings, suicide, addiction, and a lot of social ills are directly tied to what I'd call a ""loneliness epidemic"", especially among young men, and also among the elderly perhaps.

l5zh7y7,"Children generally have a fairly low risk of death in post-industrial societies, that's one of the major factors that allows for such high life expectancies, since deaths during childhood really skew the averages downward by a lot. That also means that ""low"" rates of causes of death can climb up the ladder very easily. Within the last several years firearms have become the leading cause of death in children in the US, at about 6 per 100,000 per year, with a bit less than 1/3 of that being suicide (mostly in teens) and 2/3 of that being homicides.

Of course, mass killings skew the statistics at a local level to an extreme degree. The Uvalde massacre, for example, represented a killing of over 3.5% of the entire elementary school population of that city.

dwdwe1j,"One of my best friends apparently had an underlying schizophrenic issue that no one knew about, not even him. He ate mushrooms with some friends (I wasn't there), and they said he was acting a little odd, and basically remained that way. Afterwards, he became VERY reclusive, and would extremely over analyze everything. He was shortly after diagnosed as schizophrenic. The last time I saw him, about 6 months after that last mushroom trip, I asked him how he was (casually, not like trying to pry into the rumors), and he would basically repeat every possible answer back to me. His response was to whisper things like, ""I'm fine, no. I'm alright, no. I'm good, yeah. (Then louder than a whisper) I'm good."" All with a stutter. It was strange because he was normally very goofy and out going and extremely happy. I knew he had depression issues, but never thought anything of it. He killed himself 5 days after I saw him. Schizophrenia apparently is most likely to surface between the ages of 16 and 25. He was 20 years old when this all happened.

Aside from that, one friend of mine had very strong archetypes of what people should be built onto his head, by his extremely religious family. As a result, he rebelled by being as hippy as he could, and explored psychedelics to the fullest. One night while tripping, he got very confused by the love he felt for others, of the same sex and different, and didn't understand what that meant towards who he really was. He questioned his orientation, which should be no big deal, but for him it was shattering. He's not homophobic, but I think it triggered a chain of inner questions that really shook him to the core. He's basically since recovered, but it took several years for him to rebuild a sense of self. He's now an alcoholic, and I think that it's related to his experience. 

Again, I dont blame the substances. I just find it unfortunate how these events turned out. 

For myself, psychedelics have done nothing but good. I have had some very important realizations while tripping. But I'm aware that that's not always the case, and some people either psychologically can't handle it, or have a condition that could potentially be disastrous. ",comment,Portland,0.0

2. Plan a garden for next year and look at seed catalog porn

3. Try all the winter ales I can find, but just drink one per night

4. Winter projects. Currently I am making a floor lamp. And by “currently” I mean I haven’t started yet and might not until spring, but it’s a good project to work out in my head in spare moments.

5. Snow sports and camping. Skiing, snowshoeing, winter camping. It’s quiet, peaceful and beautiful.

6. Sometimes I will just randomly drive to the coast and sit on a log on the beach and watch a storm. (Sitting on a log is hazardous if the surge is high enough to float the log with a sneaker wave. Please please please be super careful, develop a healthy respect for the ocean and never turn your back on it.)

7. Sun breaks by heading somewhere on the east side. If Bend is cloudy then keep going to Prineville, etc.

8. If it gets really bad, I look at airfare sales and find a cheap ticket to somewhere warm. If you have (or make) a friend in say Palm Springs and can stay with them, the trip doesn’t have to break the bank.

9. Vitamin D. I often forget to take it reliably.

10. Cuddle

11. Have friends over. Not for the typical partying but for something more wholesome. Cook something, just talk and catch up, listen to music, etc.

12. Volunteer with a group you like.

13. Exercise. Movement of whatever kind helps with depression. Even if you just put on a rain jacket and walk around the neighborhood. I don’t have a kayak but I think kayaking on the river would be nice.

14. Go to events. Go to games if you like sports, go to special exhibits of all kinds like the Van Gogh immersive experience at the convention center through February, go visit museums and other places of interest to you. Many libraries have free cultural passes you can check out like a book to help with admission fees. Go to pop up shops and seasonal stores. Go to the festival of lights. Just get out and be around people.

15. Teach yourself something you always wanted to learn. Give yourself freedom to fail too! Maybe it’s a skill or something more cerebral like starting a new language etc.


Basically my tips are don’t let yourself get too isolated, do projects you put off during summer, and get outside as much as you can. That sounds easy but it’s not with depression, it’s actually very hard. Try to find someone you trust to be your accountabilibuddy, someone who will come drag you out of bed if you’re still sleeping at noon on a Saturday, and you do the same for them.

To the east lies the city park of Runyon Canyon, where the beautiful people get more beautiful by dint of strenuous hiking and dog-walking. Runyon Canyon rises steeply from Franklin Avenue to Mulholland Drive. Its name comes from the 20th century, but its story began long before that, when the Tongva people camped and hunted there.

The precise geography is hazy, but in the 1860s, the government deeded about 160 acres, likely including Runyon Canyon, to the man known to history as “Greek George.” George Caralambo had helped the Army wrangle camels in a comically ill-starred try at adapting camels to military uses. Thereafter, Caralambo wandered east, through San Bernardino, where he shot a man who cheered when Caralambo’s horse lost a race, and thence to New Mexico, where he killed the governor’s son, and faked his own suicide.

He came back to L.A. and in 1867 took possession of his new acreage.

...

The canyon was bought in 1919 by coal millionaire Carman Runyon. His second wife was Winifred Kingston, the widow of Dustin Farnum. That name doesn’t resonate today, but Farnum was the star of “The Squaw Man,” the film Cecil B. DeMille made when he set up shop on the flats of Hollywood.

An Irish tenor named John McCormack bought the land in 1929. When McCormack was on tour, his estate became a high-end AirBNB for movie folk like Marie Dressler and Charles Boyer. In later years, Errol Flynn moved into the estate’s poolhouse at the invitation of his host and the next owner, Huntington Hartford, heir to grocery store millions.

In the 1960s, Hartford offered the land as a flat-out gift to the city, but for some reason, Mayor Sam Yorty turned him down. In 1984, the city was finally able to buy the land. Somehow, of all of the landowners, it was the name “Runyon” that stuck.",comment,LosAngeles,1.0

cinc8ed,"Responding after taking a big deep breath, as these discussions just spiral into terrible arguments...

I don't think that admitting that you don't like that situation, find it unpleasant, depressing, etc...means you have no heart.

Unfortunately, it is likely that stopping and donating money to your charity case du jour is not going to really make a marked difference. In SF, you could easily stop and do that...then in the next 3 blocks pass the same situation 10 times over. And you'll probably see that same person you donated money to the next day...and the day after that...etc. In all likeliness you truly are just making a donation to the closest liquor store.

Just a few weeks ago I was back in the city, out drinking, went out and had a cigarette, and bummed one to a homeless guy nearby. I talked with him, not trying to be the ""too good to talk to you"" type, and sure enough got a story about a need for BART fare somewhere. Offered to buy a ticket, and then got angry face. Finally I heard a, ""look man, I really just want some whiskey. Can you help me out?""

I'm not the first redditor that's had that story play out, and I won't be the last. And my feeling? Fuck that. I have family that has needed, and continues to need financial help, and yes, I've done that. So I'm not going to throw away money at random strangers when there's people I know who could use it.

Ignoring THAT side of the equation, there are plenty of people who need WAY more help than that. PTSD, mental issues, etc, etc. I'm sure you're aware. None of us are individually going to solve that problem by stopping every day on our way to work to tend to all the pan handlers we encounter.

So I guess if I had a point, it's that, it's everyone's problem, and when there's a problem that we all share, it's kind of...the city's problem, that they're not doing anything about, other than turning a blind eye to the condition of their transit stations and similar, and forcing everyone to put up with.

The whole thought that, if you move to SF, you either have to become Mother Theresa, or you're a heartless asshole, is a false dichotomy that I can't get on board with. I'm sure others feel differently, but that's my $.02.",comment,SanFrancisco,1.0
e0cc33t,"I've had a lifetime of depression, and after one really bad event a couple of years ago, I was just done and ready to kill myself. The people I talked to said it would just take time, but I'd get over it and be able to move on. I heard that over and over, and it was honestly frustrating because I didn't believe it (still don't).

Then I talked to my uncle, and he told me that you never get over it, you just find ways to learn to live with it. I talked to my therapist about it, and I told her I appreciated my uncle at least being honest with me when it felt like other people were just trying to say things to make me feel better regardless of how true they were or weren't, but I don't really think I'll ever learn to live with it. 

And now, I still don't think I'll ever really learn to live with it. Things haven't gotten better in my mind, I still tend to fall back to thinking about killing myself most days, and I still don't really trust anyone. I don't even keep real accounts online anymore. I only really use Reddit and occasionally delete an account and start a new one. I spend most of my time alone at this point because nothing feels worth it, and I don't feel like anyone really cares, so I just quit talking to friends. It all feels like spinning wheels until I die, and it's hard to convince myself it's worth doing it for another possibly 50+ years.

In all of this I wound up meeting my dad for the first time in my life (well, in the portion of my life I remember, he was there until I was two). He was part of the earlier depression issues and feelings of being disposable, and it didn't really help. He seems like a nice guy and all, but in ways it was hard seeing his new, happy family and comparing the stability and comfort he's given them when my whole life growing up was just instability and near-homelessness at times.

hlzl06q,"Has anyone in this thread against these camps for reasons including “them ruining your neighborhood” or “them being an eyesore” ever actually looked at the demographics of homeless populations? Grow a fucking heart.

Edit: For those who call all individuals experiencing homelessness “junkies”, and have essentially said that their demographics don’t matter because they’re “just junkies”, here is some info from the Seattle/King County Point-in-Time Count report from 2020.

“Losing a job is the most cited reason for homelessness (16%). Alcohol or drug use is the second most cited reason for homelessness (11%). Mental health issues (8%) and the inability to afford rent (8%) are the next most cited reasons for homelessness across the overall homeless population.” (p. 30)

Amongst problems faced the population, the count for alcohol use and drug use were combined, and is said to be “44%.” (p. 33). Which is lower than other problems faced by this population- depression (54%), Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (54%), and PTSD (47%) (p. 33). 

It is very common for individuals with these disorders, and other mental health concerns and disabilities, to use substances as a coping mechanism and/or to self-medicate. So, the mental health issues faced by individuals experiencing homelessness in your community could be a driving force for their substance use. It is very common to have co-occurring disorders/illnesses.

There are absolutely unjustified killings, (manslaughter or murder depending on circumstances) there are also killings that are legal, but clearly fall into the in between zone where a reasonable conclusion or a mistake led to a bad outcome, (suicide by cop where the person acts like they have a gun, draws something that looks like a gun, and points it at officers, being a classic example of this.)

i1thpzp,"Philadelphia School District implemented a new system for determining which students gain entry into the city's elite magnet schools.

The city used to use testing to see which students could gain entry into the schools based on merit.

Well last year the School District decided to throw merit out of the window in favor of a lottery system based on zip code.

They did this because they said the test was racist, because not enough black and brown students were able to pass it. 

So now entry into the city's most elite school is more based on luck than actual hard work. 

Of course the magnet schools did have a large minority population, the problem for the city was that the minority that was gaining entry to these elite schools was Asian.

With the new lottery system in place, Asian representation has been gutted in these schools, so more black and brown students can be given their slots.

Sadly, us Asian Americans don't have the numbers for either political party to bend to our whims like other minority groups do. 

Of course this article from the Inquirer completely neglects to mention how this rule change away from the tried and true method of meritocracy has greatly reduced Asian American representation on these schools.

They just completely ignored the subject altogether.

Education is very culturally important to Asian American and seeing the system be so transparently rigged against us is rly disheartening and quite frankly depressing as fuck.

Also not for nothing, there's way less Asian people in America than there are black or Hispanic people, so we are way less represented when it comes to things like politics than those minority groups.

Are we not a minority group in this country? 

Furthermore, how are Asians not included as being Brown?

I'm Asian, I'm Indian, I'm brown as fuck.

Everywhere they have implemented these rule changes New York, San Francisco it has resulted in Asian students numbers going down so other minority groups can gain those slots.

They already do this in the colleges where they come up with vague, nebulous reasons like personality scores to deny otherwise qualified Asian students admission. 

Furthermore, Affirmative Action already discriminates against Asians because we are considered overrepresented in higher education. 

It's like we are being punished for working too hard.

My partner and I had our first child there. AMAZING obstetrics program and NICU. 

...Then I wound up having an acute depressive episode over Labor Day weekend. I chose to check myself in there because we had such a great experience with the birth of my son. 

The mental health ward was a disgrace. It was dark, dingy, obvious signs of water damage everywhere. You have to share rooms with other people who have god knows what mental issues. The last night I was there, I caught my roommate just standing there pleasuring himself. A lady was screaming her head off and died. 

A nurse told me that if I wanted to get out, I had to show that I was participating in the group therapies and activities. I told her that I will, but if the sessions are just full of platitudes, I wouldn't get anything out of it. The nurse looked shocked and said, ""oh. Your chart didn't mention that you had so much clarity."" 

I had calmed down after 2 days of being in there, but I wound up in there for 5. Day 4 was Labor Day, and the nurses said that my doctor ""doesn't discharge over the holidays"". They said that no other doctor would be able to discharge me, either. So I missed my birthday as well as Labor Day. 

When my doctor was finally there on Tuesday, he didn't see me until noon. He had the fucking audacity to say to me, ""I heard you were informed of my policy on not discharging on holidays, and you were upset. How do you feel now?"" 

I told him I didn't agree with it, but it is what it is. The smirk on his face read loud and clear that if I had given him any grief, I probably wasn't going to get discharged that day, either. 

I received a HUGE kick in the pants when I first arrived on the ward: This lady from the business office was there and informed me that insurance wouldn't cover my stay. It was going to cost $7000-- did I have a credit or debit card with me I could put on record? I looked her in the eye and said, ""do you realize I'm here because I am suicidal? Do you really think it's appropriate to approach someone like that as soon as they get here to tell them that for having the nerve to seek treatment, they're going to be $7000 in the hole?"" 

At least I never saw her again, and I never did wind up owing $7000. But after that experience, I'd never recommend it.

Right now I am ending the first year here at UT and I hate myself more than when I started. I am in a very bad mindset/place right now and feel like I am stuck in a rut. I am changing my major (from CS in fact, so all you CS people can gripe a bit less about how the CS department is overridden with people who shouldn't be in CS.

The problem is, I've never done it before and it seems very intimidating. My questions is, how are the counselors here at UT? How is for someone who has never done something like it before?

Also I realize it is probably too late to talk to someone, so I was planning on just pushing through the summer or something.

I’ll still vote for Biden come November, but democrats gleefully ushering in a Great Depression while calling people “covidiots” and grandma killer for wanting to feed their families disgusts me. The fake bullshit about “not one life” while completely ignoring all the lives ruined by the lockdowns disgusts me. Shaming people who need to pay rent, or for medicine, or want to salvage a business they’ve spent their entire lives building, disgusts me. 

As far as Cuomo you should read up more on how he handled nursing homes and how red state governors noped out of that shit. He was slow on the lockdown. Slow to curb the transmissions in the subway. Then he just cops out and blames Trump for literally anything that goes wrong. 

It would be disingenuous to not admit the density of NY is a major factor, but there are major cities in red states. Lots of them. California has had some success but there’s a reason the feds are about to step in. There’s a reason they called out LA, Chicago and DC specifically. I’m saying all this as somebody who votes democrat and demands better. We’re getting shit results AND a Great Depression on top of it. That’s something most red states aren’t facing right now.

g2ya65p,"Maybe being surrounded by other people, and try my best to “count heads” of how many people I’ve come into contact recently. I *have* been to restaurants before to do my job (food photographer) &amp; rarely another person’s home or a 3rd party venue during March, May-today (sadly not April because of the closures / spike), usually with a small congregation of people (me + my assistants/food stylist whenever needed, chef, owner/other rep), socially distant / masks, so on, mostly indoors in a controlled environment, rarely outdoors (great for space, hard for photos/video &amp; production). 

Might be a bit manageable w/ for instance 3-5+ people my work process would usually have where I’m getting paid, but it’s maybe a different tale if I had to sit with crowds 5-10x that to a varying degree of backgrounds and snap photos “just for fun” again (my Reddit bio has that) &amp; pay my fair share w/ a large gratuity to compensate them for their time, because even *when* I’m doing photos just for fun, on average I take ~90 minutes or 2 hours. 

But there’s the *remote* chance someone can get sick or the naysayers who loathe wearing masks or people getting into arguments/fights, or even someone invading my personal space and the super rare chance someone can make away or destroy my gear. I have been supporting restaurants on my own volition whether it’s donations, gifting digital/physical gift cards, gifting food, so on, even if I haven’t been there in quite some time to eat. I do feel a bit happy to go out and eat sometimes and be able to socialize whether with an owner / wait staff / others, but when you can’t get too friendly while out on a job, and these aren’t really the “ideal” conditions to crack a smile and relax, I don’t know what to feel. 🤷🏼‍♂️ I probably won’t be inviting other people I share no relation with to go out and eat anytime soon either, and I don’t really have many friends these days to do just that.

I will eventually want to go out and eat just for fun, at least maybe when I take my “brave pills” (figuratively speaking) to have a birthday dinner (my 26th) at my favorite spot in the City (Wallsé) or somewhere close to home in the Hudson side of NJ around late October, but there’s plenty to think about for the next 2 months / around Halloween. Also in the meantime, I’ve been buying other camera gear for my “just for fun” work separate from what I use for my job, so maybe another limit is knowing “when I’m ready” to share content again for my social media platforms once more (separate from work). I do feel a bit depressed I’ve lost friends, people I know, and business I was proud to support over this (&amp; of course clients who I value my services to work w/ me), so it does need a bit more thought.",comment,NYC,1.0

How those two are linked I'm still trying to work out. If we are seeing an increase in suicides then something is happening, it just so happens some of these guys who are suicidal also want to take out people with them.


Trying to pass legislation to increase backgrounds and red flags won't stop a suicidal person from killing themselves. Likewise, it won't stop someone who is suicidal and motivated on causing harm from procuring a firearm or using another method. I've heard the argument but if it saves one life ...

htzw02s,"First of all, I just want to say that KHOU while it recorded massive crime hikes in certain zip codes overall they saw a 5% decrease in crime from last year; though still higher since pre-pandemic. Read the story here:
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.khou.com/amp/article/news/investigations/map-violent-crime-rising-houston/285-1b94555d-7cd9-4458-853d-82753787c1ce

1. Population density and city growth - Overall crime tends to always be higher in metropolises. LA, Chicago, New York, Houston. The more the city expands, the more the density increases, and the more the gang activity festers. Crime fighting will always be a constant battle as cities grow.

2. Covid - Covid has made people restless and irritable. It's also taken a lot of jobs and Houston is still not intended to make a full recovery until 2023 upping the desperation of some to turn to property and violent crime. In addition, it has caused massive issues for jails and prisons, where it spreads like wildfire and where no facilities are equipped to fully be able to handle a contagion flawlessly. Judges are forced to make decisions on which prisoners to let out on bonds to reduce jail exposure risks. Additionally many convicted felons in the Harris County jail are just waiting for a bus to TDCJ to serve their prison tike but TDCJ for a lo g time was refusing to take ANY new prisoners and even now they require a lot of points be met to take them. This leads to jail overcrowding by individuals that should already be housed in a prison setting. The Harris County jail inmate population tends to stay consistently at around 10,000 inmates which is dangerously close to the maximum housing capabilities. Releasing these inmates to reduce risk causes a big revolving catch and release door where criminals are not feeling the deterrent of actual isolation from being jailed and are back on the street doing the same things mere hours after their initial arrest.

3. Backed up criminal court system - End of July it was recorded that the Harris County criminal courts were sitting on a 98,000 backlog of cases, of which over 51,000 were felony offenses. 19,000 of these cases showed active and had been pending a resolution for over a year. There are 22 felony judges, each with about 2300-2400 cases on their docket they have to juggle. We opened a brand new court which was the first addition of a felony court in over 30 years despite year to year growth. This brand new court is already showing almost 2500 cases on its docket. Theoretically if you were to arrest NO ONE starting right now and have no new cases, it would still take Harris County approximately a year just to clear the backlog alone. Because of this, judges are imposing weak penalties and sometimes dismissing violent cases altogether to clear the backlogs and free up jail space. It is hard to deter criminals if they keep beating their cases or only doing g probation or light sentences for horribly violent crimes. This backlog started with Hurticane Harvey, and before they could clear the backlog, the addition of Covid-19 exasperated the backlog to the current crisis levels. It is about to get even worse because we have been renting space from NRG to do jury selection on massive scales. During the rodeo in February and March wr cannot use this space for jury selection, which will slow the criminal courts trials down to a crawl for the next two months and only serve to increase the backlog

Police Quitting and Retiring - Movements in the US have created a ""war on the police"" mentality online and offline. With no real deterrents, criminals are bold enough to continue executing police officers in broad daylight without true consequence. If police fight back using ACCEPTED use of force continuum levels of force, somethibg the average citizen either doesn't understand or doesn't care to understand, they are demonized and the criminals praised for fighting back against ""the man."" This along with other items have caused many officers that had earned their retirement years ago but chose to stay on actively past their retirement eligibility date because they loves what they do to suddently cash in on their retirements. New officers in an effort to meet police recruitment demands are being rushed through the hiring and training process, waiving critical and important steps to fill slots. Sometimes this even amounts to lying to recruits about job expectations. When the recruits finally drop in, they quit because the description they were given was nothing like it really is in current counter-police culture. Mass retirement, mass turnover, and firings due to minor policy violations that were blown up by social media and cancel culture eliminate any net gain of police personnel. Officer suicide rates are also extremely high now. Any new potential recruit pretty soon is going to run far away from their dreams of becoming a cop because of whst they see on social media every day on how they are treated. Pretty soon a breakdown of basic social services is going to happen on a massive scale regarding first responders as there will not be enough people to even respond to the smaller tier of violent crimes in progress.",comment,Houston,1.0

I'm in my mid 20s and I've had severe hemorrhoids for about 2 years now. They've completely ruined my life.

My cousin was pushed out of adult prison reform (ended up working with kids) and eventually left the country. His stories are very depressing. Any of the yoga group returning home immediately is not a red flag in my book.

I went to Lake Atitlan myself a few years ago. I did not swim in the water as it is very polluted and people have come down with bacterial infections. However if I was going to swim- I’d stay by the shore vs. further out as Nancy did. The water is very dark and cold. 

I did manage to get horrific food poisoning while there. It’s really hard to speculate how Nancy’s health was, but generally I’d believe the eye witness who saw her go in the water and not come out.

&gt; 
&gt; She said she feels **it would be irresponsible to simply say these suicides are happening solely because schools are closed**.  She said it’s a factor, but another factor is that **what was wrong before the pandemic is still wrong and needs to be addressed**.
&gt; 
&gt; According to Roberts, **the challenge going forward will be the fact that Nevada Medicaid, the biggest provider of mental health care that a vast number of children fall under, is seeing major cuts**. 
&gt; 
&gt; It’s harder and harder to get sessions approved, she said, and Medicaid has warned providers to expect a 6% claw back on money paid out, so it’s going to affect the mental healthcare system.

cgoiydv,"I agree with a lot of what you say, but pets are also a lot of work. I have a 10 year old dog, leaving him home to go to work/school/socialize even for 2 hours increases my anxiety/OCD because I worry constantly about something happening to the little guy. Service animals are great for cheering people up in hospitals, but there is a huge difference between playing with a dog for a few hours every now and then and taking care of one 24/7. 

I don't disagree that they can have positive effects on the lives of people with depression and anxiety, but sometimes having that responsibility can aggravate those feelings. It can also make it hard for a person to properly care for their pet in difficult times, it's not all snuggles, it's wonderful but sassy little animals that need attention and exercise even when you're sick/sad/busy etc.

dvy6u7,"Troubleshooting, Homelessness I am a convicted felon and I am homeless. Others have counseled me to find ways to fit within society, but I just can’t.

I was not a very good student. More than one of my teachers marked me down as a failure. I barely graduated high school. The institutions of this culture have blamed me for not fitting in, for not functioning within the social order. 

I am taking the time to write this is because I feel I can offer an alternative perspective on the homelessness problem in American culture. It seems that the liberal minded folks view homelessness as some kind of affliction or temporary condition while at the same time the conservative folks view the homeless as lazy free-loaders who are looking to get something for nothing. There may be some truth to both of these views but neither is right.

When I was younger there were times when I was afraid that maybe my culture was right about me; maybe there is something inherently dysfunctional about me. But the older I get the more I can clearly see that the fault is not within me, instead there is something very faulty about the culture I live in. 

I was able to graduate high school only because of a vocational program. I took automotive mechanics classes at school and got class credits for working in an automotive shop down the street from the school. 

Auto mechanics made sense to my brain. For the first time in my life something made sense to me. I liked that there is nothing arbitrary or random about a four stroke internal combustion engine. I liked that an engine functions because of the laws of physics, and that the reason the thing either is, or is not running is a matter of simple cause and effect. 

It made sense to me that a four-stroke gasoline engine does not “like” me, nor does it dis-like me. The engine does not continue running because it is being nice, nor is the reason that it stops working because it is angry at me. A four stroke engine needs three things in order to run: a fuel source, an ignition source, and a functional compression chamber. If the engine will not run one of these three simple things is the reason. 

As a high school kid I liked auto mechanics because is was so black and white, there are no random variables. With people it is more complex; a person can express dysfunction, anger or even hostility at you, but the reason they are angry may not have anything to do with you.

In auto mechanics class I learned the basic concepts of mechanical troubleshooting. I learned that if you want to fix something you have to first figure out exactly what is broken. Just as importantly you need to understand how, or why the failure happened. 

I was born into poverty. I had to learn how to work on cars because the only car I could afford was the kind that keeps breaking down. When I turned 16 my parents helped me buy a $500 car from a friend. The car had been wrecked more than once and it was in rough shape, but I was 16 and head-over-heals with excitement. On the first day of school the car broke down as I was pulling out of the school parking lot. If I wanted my transportation freedom I was going to have to figure out how to fix this car.

There was a time when my crappy car kept breaking fan-belts. I began buying fan belts in pairs so that I would always have an extra one. One day I was explaining to my auto shop teacher that I always keep an extra belt because my car keeps throwing them. In my teen-aged mind I was on top of the problem. I was proud of myself for thinking ahead by being prepared for the next time it happened. The shop teacher looked at me with a perplexed grin, he said: “instead of replacing the fan belt every time it fails, why don’t you figure out what is causing the belt to fail in the first place.”

There were many frustrated moments when my crappy car broke down. I got stranded many times and many places. I can remember being overwhelmed with anger, there were times when I wanted to take a big sledge hammer and smash that engine to bits. I can still hear the voice of my shop teacher: “You can do that if you want. It might even make you feel better, but only until you realize what kind of damage you have done”. “What is the thing you hope to achieve” he would ask. “If the thing you want to accomplish is to vent your aggression, then smashing the engine might help, but if your goal is to have a functioning car then you're more likely to accomplish your goal if you figure out what’s wrong with it rather than smashing it.”

I am in my mid 40’s now. I have experienced times of economic success and I have endured times of economic oppression. 

For over 20 years I have worked in the home building and home remodeling industry; the housing industry. I have seen the housing industry flourish and I have seen the market frenzy and then crash. 

During the years leading up to the 2008 crash I was working as a middle level manager for one of the worlds largest residential home builders. I had joined because I wanted to learn how a big construction company works. I expected that I was going to take what I learned and one day start a large construction firm of my own. What I learned by working for a corporate home builder caused me to lose my appetite for business. 

I worked as a customer service manager for a fortune 500 homebuilding corporation for about five years. I learned what it took to be successful in the industry that provides the basic human need for shelter. After learning what it takes to be successful and profitable in business I became lost and depressed. I didn't want to do what it is you have to do in order to be competitive in the building industry. My disillusion and depression had nothing to do with being lazy or having an unwillingness to work hard, I was deflated by how aggressive and apathetic you have to be towards those you do business with. 

Business is all about relationships and partnerships. For a building contractor there are only three primary groups of relationships: the relationship with customers, the relationship with the contractors who build the homes, and the relationships with the suppliers who provide the raw building materials. 

In order to be successful at business a company has to make sure that it profits from each and every relationship it enters into. A builder cannot be successful unless it makes sure that it’s relationship with the customer, the sub-contractor, and the material suppliers are each more profitable to the builder than not. If a builder is generous to the subcontractor, or pays for more expensive materials, or if the builder gives the customer too good a deal, the builder will not be profitable and will go out of business. 

I learned that in order to be successful in business you have to make sure that you leverage each and every relationship to your own benefit. If you do not leverage your relationships to be profitable to you then you will not be able to compete because the other builder has no problems squeezing his customers, his sub-contractors and his suppliers for more profit. 

As a customer service manager during the housing bubble of the early 2000’s I witnessed first hand how large corporations leverage more profitable relationships. My personal yearly bonus was directly tied to my warranty spending budgets. If I spent money to make a warranty repair on one of our homes my yearly bonus got smaller, regardless of the legitimacy of the warranty claim. If I spent less money, or better yet, no money repairing warranty issues then my year-end bonus would be bigger, much bigger.

Not too long ago there was an abundance of land here on planet Earth. There was a time when a person could go find a place to set up a homestead and live. There was a time when there was so much land here in America that they were giving it away (although it belonged to the indigenous people). As our culture fuels its discontent with perpetual growth and consumption the availability of Earth becomes more scarce. The law of supply and demand is at work upon our basic human need for shelter.

Early in American development land was more available and housing was more affordable. As our population continues to exponentially increase the demand for Earth and shelter are ever increasing as well. 

There are a few personality types who are driven and fueled by competition. There are some people who thrive within a competitive social environment. But these are people who are not content within themselves and are therefor driven to feed their discontent. There are some people, a few people for whom the social system is working very well. There are also many, many people for whom the social system is not working for at all. 

Not all human beings are the same. Some are better at the game of competition than others. Some are more suited to dominate-or-be-dominated. Some people don’t want to compete. Some people don’t want to capitalize nor do they want to be capitalized upon. There are fewer and fewer options. 

Many of us are working hard to improve our lives. We seek wealth without work, and “passive income”. We seek higher education so that we don’t have to do manual labor jobs (no one wants to actually work). Within the housing industry real estate speculators are flipping properties and acquiring rental units that yield passive income. 

I have had opportunities to acquire rental property. Passive income sounds great, but I cannot sit on a beach in some tropical place collecting money from a single mom who is working her ass off to keep her head above water and keep her kids fed. I wouldn't be able to live with myself. I do not have it in my heart to exploit the basic needs of another human.

I believe in hard work. I actually like hard, physical work. The truth is I genuinely enjoy manual labor, especially when I benefit from the fruit of my own labors. I have no problem with wealth either. I think wealth is a great benefit to anyone who works honestly to acquire it. I have a strong respect for a person who has generated wealth by means of his own labor, but I despise those who generate wealth by capitalizing upon the labors of others. 

The American dream has turned into a dream of wealth without work. In our culture people do not get wealthy by digging ditches, instead people get wealthy by figuring out ways to get other people to dig ditches for their benefit. The owner of Mcdonalds, or of Wallmart or Homedepot are not doing the manual tasks of making burgers or stocking shelves but they are living comfortable lives by profiting off of this labor. 

Our social system is an economic pyramid scheme. The wide base of the pyramid is the poverty level while the narrow top is where the fewest and wealthiest people exist. Those who are able to leverage themselves into the higher levels of the social pyramid do so by standing upon the labors of those who exist under them. 

The pyramid gets narrower and narrower the higher you go up. The effect is that upward mobility is a lie, it is a false carrot meant to keep the lower levels of the pyramid motivated to keep working in the hopes that they too can one day achieve economic “success”. 

But the fact is there are exponentially more people below the poverty line than there are above it. There are more people in the working class than there are in the white-collar class, There are far fewer millionaires than there are in the working class. There are fewer billionaires than there are millionaires, and there are even fewer trillion-aires than there are millionaires. 

The pyramid scheme is build upon the format of competition. This means that there are billions of people who are forced to live in poverty because they are being out-competed by those who are one level up from them in the competitive pyramid scheme. The people who exist within the working class would prefer to enjoy greater wealth, but the people who have managed to work themselves into management positions have out-competed them. 

The people who have managed to be at the top of the social pyramid scheme don’t get there, or stay in their positions of advantage by giving their wealth away. The billionaires are not looking down to the lower levels in the pyramid scheme they are looking up. The billionaires are not reaching down to offer opportunity and wealth to those in poverty or to those in the working class. 

Our social workers are pretending to lift people up out of their circumstances but this is nothing other than a show. There are stories, or examples of the few who have climbed up from disadvantage and have gained an advantage, but statistically speaking this phenomenon does not really happen. There are billions of humans living in poverty. If you look at the statistics the numbers will show you that a person who has been born into poverty will live their entire life in poverty and will die in poverty. It is true that one in a million will achieve a breakthrough but it is less than one percent who will accomplish this. Less than one percent, according to the science of statistics is an insignificant probability. In other words it happens so rarely that you should not consider it to be a possibility. 

The social pyramid stands upon the backs of human labor. Our society cannot afford to lift people out of poverty because someone has to do the manual labor jobs that support the mangers and supervisor positions. The managers and supervisors can’t be what they are if there is no one to manage and supervise. 

Most of us exist somewhere in the middle of the economic pyramid scheme. Do you eat fruit? Who picks the fruit that you eat? How much did you pay the person who picked the fruit that you eat? Maybe you paid a dollar for that avocado, how much of that dollar went into the pocket of the person who makes their living picking avocados? What kind of life is that person able to afford? 

What about the clothing that you are wearing right now? Take a look at the tag. Who made the clothing that you are wearing? How much did you pay for the clothing that you are wearing and how much did the person who made that clothing get paid to make what you wear? What kind of life is the person who made your clothing able to afford to live? 

The people who live in the middle of the economic pyramid are mostly apathetic to those who exist under them. We are blind to how our quest for cheap clothing and food impacts the people who produce our clothing and food. We simply don’t think about it. We can’t afford to be empathic to those who are underneath us because we are fighting for our own economic well-being. 

Living in the middle of the economic pyramid scheme means that we are both economically oppressed and we are also the oppressor. We live in a culture which flies the banner of freedom but we are not a free society; we are economic slaves. You are not living the life that you would like to live, you are living the life that you ‘have’ to live. On a daily basis you do not do the things you want to do, you do the things you ‘have’ to do. If you won the lottery your life would change. If you won the lottery you would quit your job and would then be able to do the things you want to do rather than being forced to submit to your employer’s will. 

In any given 24 hour day your time, your labor, your energy and your efforts are going to the things that this culture socially expects of you. Your waking hours are spent taking care of responsibilities and social obligations. At the end of the day very few, if any of **your** day’s hours are spent on **you;** you are a slave.

You go to work every day, not because you want to but because you have to. If you won the lottery tonight would you quit your job? Any one of us would. We go to work because we are being made to pay, in time spent laboring for our employer, in exchange for the money we are made to pay in order to acquire what we need to meet our basic human needs. 

Our basic human needs are being exploited. We are being extorted for our basic needs. Humans have created a cultural system in which a privileged few profit and benefit each and every time you fulfill any one of your basic human needs. Our system functions on the principal of “supply and demand”, if there is a demand there is an opportunity to capitalize. Since our basic human needs are obligatory (not optional) there will always be demand for things like food and shelter. We cannot live without these things therefor the demand is absolute. Since the demand for our basic human needs is absolute, there is a tremendous opportunity to capitalize, or exploit. 

It is theorized that the abolishment of slavery is the event that trigged the industrial revolution. The industrial revolution likely could have, and would have happened much earlier except that mechanization and automation were deliberately suppressed by slave owners. Slave owners already had a mechanized way to bring fresh water from the well to the house. The slave owners already had a system for harvesting crops, delivering messages, doing laundry, and all other laborious tasks. The industrial revolution was resisted because mechanization was a threat to the practice of slavery. 

Slavery did not go away, it only changed faces. We traded chattel slavery for economic slavery. Economic slavery is more sneaky and covert than chattel slavery. In the days of chattel slavery, the slaves understood that they were enslaved. Today’s economic slavery is a form of mental slavery in which we are conditioned, programed and “educated” from an early age to willingly participate in the social pyramid scheme. 

The social system we are forced to live under dictates that we have only two options: we can either be the hammer or we can be the nail. No one wants to be the nail, so most are striving to be the hammer. But there is a movement taking place in which people are trying to find ways to get out from under the social system. 

The social system is working just fine for some people but not for everyone. There are plenty of people who thrive in competition. There are specific personality types who thrive in a dog-eat-dog social arena. But this system does not work for everyone. There is a significant portion of the population who simply can not keep up with the level of competition. There are many who do not thrive in a competitive environment. There are many who simply do not have the disposition or the heart to do what it takes to achieve economic “success”. 

There are many people who are seeking ways to get out from under economic oppression. Really, everyone is trying to free themselves from economic pressure, but everyone has different approaches or strategies for seeking economic security. Some are striving to out-compete others in order to gain economic comfort, others are finding ways to opt-out from the economic pyramid. In recent years we have seen several social movements towards a more independent economic life. After the recent economic crisis many people have gravitated towards prepping and homesteading. If one can find a way to pay for a piece of Earth to start a homestead, this is a great way to disconnect from the social pyramid, but who can afford to buy land? 

The Tiny House revolution is rooted in a desire to exist here on planet Earth without being extorted for the privilege of existing here on planet Earth. Living in a Tiny space may come with it’s own set of challenges but if it can be done without having to pay a mortgage the trade-offs are worth it to many.

The digital nomad movement is another example of a group of people who are looking to free themselves from the confines of the life that we are offered under this economic system. Many are striving to experience a larger part of planet Earth. Not all of us are happy being pinned down by rents and mortgages.

Van Life is a cultural movement in which countless people are choosing to live in their automobiles rather than seeking an apartment or traditional house. 

And there is, of course, the homeless population. In the last ten years we have seen the homeless population increase exponentially. The streets of every city in the US are lined with tents and homeless camps. Cities like Seattle and Portland have been essentially overrun by the massive numbers of homeless people. 

Homelessness is a cultural epidemic. It has not always been like this, why is it happening? Basic troubleshooting says if your goal is to actually repair the problem you have to identify and address the root cause.

There is a palpable resentment aimed at the homeless population. There is a significant part of working people who look down their noses with contempt at the homeless. The root of these feelings of contempt is spite. The people who hold resentment towards the homeless use terms like “entitlement” when describing their interpretation of homeless mentality. 

The people who are directing anger at the homeless resent their own economic oppression. Many of the people who are working very hard to pay for the basic need for shelter are resentful of the people who choose to live on a sidewalk. At the root of this anger is the feeling that “If I have to work for what I have then you should too”. 

The people who are working hard to pay the banks for the basic human need for shelter don’t want to have to work either. Everyone wants to hang out all day and do whatever they want to do rather than working. The people who are working to pay the bill collectors are resenting the people who are “cheating” by finding ways to avoid paying rent. 

The homeless people have made a choice. There are charitable organizations which will employ just about anyone. Goodwill hires people of all aptitudes and skill levels. If a person wanted to get a job at a company like Goodwill there is nothing preventing them. The homeless are choosing to live the way they are living because the burdens of economic slavery are too much for them to bear. 

The more liberal minded people see homelessness as an affliction. This is the perspective of a person who has a relatively comfortable, well-paying job. The more liberal people have a hard time comprehending that someone might willingly choose homelessness over wage-slavery. 

Many people believe that the “disease” of addiction is the cause of homelessness for many if not most. It is true that a large part of the homeless population are addicted to heavy drugs, but there are just as many drug addicted soccer moms and corporate lawyers. It’s just that soccer moms and corporate lawyers can afford to pay for the drugs they take (supplying the Mexican drug cartels with an abundance of wealth). 

Everyone is emotionally coping with economic oppression. Everyone is using tactics to distract from, or mask their deeper emotional pain and discontentment. We are an emotionally repressed people so we are not in tune with our deeply rooted emotional discontent, but everyone of us are using tactics which attempt to cope with our repressed discontent. 

Some people use drugs as an emotional escape from their emotionally oppressive realities. Other people use the emotional effects of food to comfort their repressed emotional discontent. Some distract themselves with exercise or gambling, or social media, or extreme sports. Some people become addicted to the emotional feelings they get from work and money. Those who are addicted to generating wealth are emotionally driven to be the economic “winners” of this cultural game at the expense of the countless humans who loose.

Addiction is a symptom not a disease. There is nothing faulty with anyone who chooses to immerse themselves in drugs rather than face the daily realities of economic slavery. The reality is: if you were born into poverty you are going to live and die in poverty. When the social game is rigged against you, there is nothing broken or damaged about a person who chooses to hide in the emotional effects of drugs. When a person has no hope, no possibility of gaining security or comfort, drugs are the best option for escape. 

Being homeless is not fun, its just the better option than working endlessly at a minimum-wage job without healthcare and never getting ahead of the bill collectors. It sucks when it is cold and rainy and you have no place to shelter except a fast food restaurant. The fast food manager does not want you there. You get dirty looks all day long. But there is no place to go. Choosing to live on the streets is the lesser of two evils for the most impoverished humans.

There has been a deliberate effort to make homelessness a very uncomfortable existence. The standard approach to dealing with people who do not cooperate with slavery has been to make non-cooperation more difficult and uncomfortable than the enslavement itself. The idea is if you make life miserable for those who do not submit or comply, then they may give up and willingly choose to submit because it is less painful.

Slave masters understand that they can no longer employ force to make people participate in the economic scheme, so instead they actively try to make non-cooperation, or non-participation much more uncomfortable than working to pay the bill collectors. The debt collectors are of course the modern version of the slave hunters who once used hound dogs track down humans who tried to not participate in slavery.

I once got a ticket for not having insurance on my truck. As has been the case many times in my life I could barely afford to keep gas in the tank, I could not afford insurance. I received a ticket for $600. This approach makes no sense at all. A person cannot afford to pay for insurance so your solution is to make them pay a fine? How does this fix anything? 

Remember that basic troubleshooting I learned back in auto shop class? What is it that you hope to accomplish here? If your goal is to make sure that I have insurance on my vehicle then how is giving me a $600 fine going to get us closer to that goal? The logic that the lawyers are using to try and solve social problems is childish and non-sensical. Lawyers are the least qualified people for repairing social problems.

I dont want to write a 5 page report on the socioeconomic class of black people and how as a group this ethnicity has been systematically oppressed for several generations. Add that to the mixture of segregation and inherent racism that still affects black people in resume call back. Theres also another side to this issue which is the USA backpedaling their ww2 propaganda and accepting well educated and financially stable Asian family as migrants. So Asian people are a minority in that many are considered immigrants or 2nd generation immigrants that could afford to up their entire life to move to a country that's about 12 hour plane ride away. Asians need to be compared to other immigrants, while black people need to be compared to other generational Americans in the same socioeconomic bracket. I mean I can keep going and going. Crack epidemic in the 80s ruining families. Asian cultures have a higher rate of suicide... is it because of collectivism vs individualism.

What I'm saying is that comparing two groups of people and saying why cant this group be like that group is crazy when these groups are so different.

The Virginia Tech shooting, also known as the Virginia Tech massacre, occurred on April 16, 2007, on the campus of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia, United States. Seung-Hui Cho, a senior at Virginia Tech, shot and killed 32 people and wounded 17 others in two separate attacks (another six people were injured escaping from classroom windows), approximately two hours apart, before committing suicide.:92:78

The attacks received international media coverage and drew widespread criticism of U.S. gun culture. At the time, it was the deadliest shooting carried out by a single gunman in U.S. history. It sparked intense debate about gun violence, gun laws, gaps in the U.S. system for treating mental health issues, the perpetrator's state of mind, the responsibility of college administrations, privacy laws, journalism ethics, and other issues.

dc3fjws,"North Korea would need to have a functional ICBM in order to do that, and all of their missiles, even their best ones, are medium range that would not be able to reach the west coast.  Not to mention that they're wildly shitty in design and construction and have a tendency to either explode on the launch pad, veer hundreds of miles off course, or plunge directly into the ocean.

Next they'd need to have the technology to miniaturize a nuclear warhead to fit on an ICBM, another piece of tech that they don't have the capability to produce.

Lastly, they'd need a nuclear warhead that can actually undergo a criticality.  I think only one of their warhead tests have actually shown results going super-critical and initiating the fusion reaction and all the rest have been fizzles.  Still relatively strong in terms of conventional weaponry, but a fizzled nuke is essentially a gnat when you're talking about power in terms of kilotons and megatons.

Assuming North Korea had all of these preconditions met and the regime was suicidal enough to actually launch a nuclear missile at the US, Seattle and the surrounding area would only be a target if:

* The North Koreans had enough ICBMs to hit bigger, more important targets first like Los Angeles, New York, and Washington DC

* They only have the one missile and Seattle is the only target worth expending it on due to the range and weight restrictions on the missile itself

* They want to give the US a giant FUCK YOU by nuking a major city just because they can, even knowing full well that the resulting response would be their total and complete annihilation in a nuclear hellfire as the US launches a fleet of the 300 kiloton Minuteman III missiles at any target worth more than a dollar.

fyp3ga4,"&gt; And unfortunately right now that same safety net can kill them and then when those kids go home they will spread the virus to their parents which will also kill them

Children face very little risk of dying from Covid.  Their mortality mostly comes from accidents and suicide.  Those will probably increase without school and outweigh the small reduction in deaths that schools being closed will prevent.  

Child also do not appear to be a major source of Covid transmission.  There's little to no evidence to support the idea that closing schools will help stop the spread.  Nor that it will ultimately serve to protect any children.  The kids in my area are having team sport practices and playing on the playground.  Even with school closed there's more than enough chance for them to transmit it.  

&gt;It's not an easy choice but financial issues can change, you can eventually get out of it, you cannot beat death if you are dead.

EDIT: What I learned about effort, is that the amount of effort it takes one person to do a task, is very different to the amount of effort it takes another person to do a task. This is the case for people suffering from any type of mental illness like depression or adhd, but also it's related to neuro-typicals.

[Injuries an Death Due to Firearms in the Home](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9715182)

&gt;RESULTS:

&gt;During the study interval (12 months in Memphis, 18 months in Seattle, and Galveston) 626 shootings occurred in or around a residence. This total included 54 unintentional shootings, 118 attempted or completed suicides, and 438 assaults/homicides. Thirteen shootings were legally justifiable or an act of self-defense, including three that involved law enforcement officers acting in the line of duty. For every time a gun in the home was used in a self-defense or legally justifiable shooting, there were four unintentional shootings, seven criminal assaults or homicides, and 11 attempted or completed suicides.

&gt;CONCLUSIONS:

&gt;**Guns kept in homes are more likely to be involved in a fatal or nonfatal accidental shooting, criminal assault, or suicide attempt than to be used to injure or kill in self-defense.**

Exactly why it is so frustrating to hear the ""demands"" of these protestors. Such a clear lack of understanding of history, let alone the longstanding geopolitics of the region. But the plight of the Palestinians just fits a bit too nicely into the oppressor/oppressed viewpoint (so long as you ignore a whole lot of other stuff) that progressives have applied to our own politics, so they have convinced themselves that since the Palestinians are oppressed, almost any action against the oppressor is valid. You know, even things like October 7th.

I'm guessing most of these kids don't fully comprehend what a chant of ""from the river to the sea"" actually means (that would be Israel not existing anymore, guys).

ewroivq,"Yet cars kill WAAAAAAAY more fucking people. The analogy above applies, you're grasping at straws. When are we going to cut dicks off to stop rape?

Remove suicides and gang shootings and suddenly guns are safer than a backyard pool. Sure, they're designed to kill, but if you want to chase that line of thinking then you're screwed when it comes to the stats. With roughly 400M guns in the US and ~1T rounds, gun violence (including suicides, cop shootings, and gang violence stats) a gun has a (393M guns, 39773 deaths) 0.000102% killing effectivity rate.

Now, lets do cars: 293M cars on the road, 36750 deaths - 0.000125% killing effectivity rate.

Cars are 20% more deadly - demonstrated.

Sure guns are meant to kill and cars aren't. However, add the human factor and society has decided that the better tool to kill with is the automobile. 

Oh, and take the suicides out of the equation and cars now kill three times as many people as guns do. 

So what are you worried about now? How people die, or that they're dying? It sounds like you have an issue with how they die, not that they in fact die. This is why malpractice and hospital acquired infections get off scott free. With 600,000 deaths a year from malpractice and hospital acquired infections you'd think that it would be more of an issue (Hospitals in the US are the #1 killer of people in the US by nearly 50,000 deaths). But people are reactionary, emotional, and care more about the manner in which people are killed, not that they're killed...I mean, who gives a fuck if they're killed right?

ek0zaoj,"The NYT has a good daily podcast called The Daily where they do a great job of digging into a topic in the news in depth. It’s both current events since they’ll do episodes on big stories in the news, but also just general topics like Brexit, immigration, etc. Each episode is about 30 minutes. 

I’m also a fan of Invisibilia, Embedded, RadioLab, This American Life, and Freakonomics which all deal with various cultural and economic topics. RadioLab has a spin-off podcast called More Perfect that’s all about the Supreme Court that’s really interesting, if you’re into that sort of thing. 

Podcasts on single topics I binged in the last year that I really enjoyed include “The Assassination” about the assassination of Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto as told by a BBC correspondent who knew her. 

“Broken Harts” was all about the local Hart family who commit suicide and killed their adopted children in the process. It was really difficult to listen to given their local connection, but also eye-opening. 

“Bundyville” was a good dive into the Bundy family (as in the Malheur wildlife refuge occupying Bundya) and what drives their religion and politics. Also good local connection.

c6vfiij,"A coworker and I were discussing this issue this morning and just running through some ideas. 

The first issue being that without a trained physician administering the treatment you could run into complications due to body chemistry/size/not using all the pills which could lead to situations that are not a simple painless death. Although I am unsure if there are issues with doctors administering assisted suicide and the Hippocratic oath, which is probably why the issue is presented this way.

Second, once the prescription is signed the pills are the responsibility of whoever has them, you have a deadly easily concealable substance that could be stolen/abused in the wrong hands. 

Third, Massachusetts is already struggling with an Oxycotin issue, so the idea of introducing more pills, in 100 dose batches,to the street just seems like it's a recipe for abuse. 

Fourth, the lack of a clinical psych evaluation prior to getting approval is a little shocking as well. Depression is a common issue with terminal sentences and without proper consultation a patient might be making a hasty decision without thinking it through completely.

Again, I am for the idea of assisted suicide in cases where a person of sound mind and body has determined that it is not worth living out a terminal diagnosis in pain. But I also know that poorly written ballot measures dealing with life and death should be very thorough and iron clad in their execution. I also believe that a trained professional should be present at all points during the process for both comfort of the patient, as well as control of the substance.",comment,Boston,1.0

Why are you homeless?

I don’t have skills, too old and out of mindset to gain skills and too depressed and addicted.

When I was younger, one mistake led to another and I lost my chance to gain skills to maintain a career. Addictions were a constant hindrance and a vicious cycle. I was using or drinking so I couldn’t get skills, I had a set back so I used and drank to keep the pain away.

Why were you using and drinking?

Because it was so good initially, I got hooked and it was a decade downhill or failure to thrive.

cwaqny6,"Whenever the conversation about property taxes comes up here, there are always people citing the 'unfairness' of the current system.

Yes - the current system does create situations where the value of a taxed value is incongruous with others in the neighborhood, but also advocating that peoples homes get re-accessed based on market values can also be really unfair to homeowners. 

The fact that someone owns a home in a particular neighborhood doesn't say anything about their resources, it just means they owned their home. 

Maybe that person is elderly and has lived there for 30 years and paid it off. Maybe that person bought in the neighborhood when it was cheaper, because they have limited income and they didn't plan for the neighborhood and home prices to change drastically. 

When you buy a home, you take on the risk of the mortgage, and all of the repairs and bad things that can happen to you as a property owner (such as the liability for someone getting hurt on your property).

Sure, some people benefit from this system, including folks who have the resources to pay more in taxes. There are other people who benefit too, like those who have fixed or barely budging incomes, and aren't able to take significant jumps in property taxes, and would be forced out of their homes if they were reassessed based on today's market.

I for one bought during the recession, back when no-one thought homeownership was a good idea (people at the time told me that I was throwing money away because renting was so cheap), and our neighborhood was, and in some places is, one of the most violent in Portland (there have been three murders within walking distance of our home since we've moved here). I am not a person of means. My wife was a receptionist at the time, and I worked at a really awful call center. We cleared out all of our savings and 401k, and got a modest gift from her father. 

We are a bit more financially secure now, and could probably pay a bit more on our taxes. We could not afford, however, if the city decided to tax us at the rate that the market says our home is worth. Even if we sold and got those funds, we would have to leave Portland, because even with a much more sizable down payment we couldn't afford to buy a home, even in East Portland.

Basically if what is happening with these ADUs were to happen across the board, I think you'd see more gentrification and more people forced out, because they couldn't afford their tax bill.

When we bought our the taxes went up 10% that year, because that is one of the times when taxes can go up more than 3%. I found it strange that the taxes went up, though, because the market was depressed at the time.

So if we do sell our places, the value can be re-accessed and the new owners can pay at a rate that more closely matches the value of their home, and they too will be protected from outrageous tax hikes until they sell. I do not think it is a terrible system. I think it could be better, but people shouldn't be taxes based on the old system- which was basically a free-for-all. 'Budget needs' doesn't protect people, and I've yet to see a taxes ever go down based on 'Budget Needs'.

As far as having a REAL urban lifestyle, That’s why I pay a fortune to live where I live - 4 full scale grocery stores within a 6 minute walk. Plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, hardware store, plant nursery etc etc etc. It made it so I could get rid of my car without actually causing a major disruption to my day to day life (and honestly after being forced to live in Los Angeles for work work for the two years preceding the pandemic I was THRILLED to get rid of that car. That city’s lifestyle is so unbelievably unhealthy and depressing. Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive…..never again.)

Increasingly the power is being wrenched away from those who have professional knowledge and experience by the increasing power of those who are ""closer to the money"". The managerial class, the MBA types, the ""non-technical co-founders"", the venture capitalists, and so on. This is happening in every field, from engineering and manufacturing to software to medicine to education and so on. Folks who are extremely talented, experienced, capable, and even highly credentialed are increasingly being given the ""de-skilling treatment"", are increasingly being micro-managed or simply what I would call ""vague managed"" by folks who have power and authority but little knowledge of the actual work at play.

Suffice it to say that this pattern is absolutely corrosive to productivity, effectiveness, capability, and retention of talent. If you pay close enough attention you can watch it hollow out entire industries over the years and decades like the progress of an invasive beetle through a forest, leaving behind devastation.

e0xe2ig,"Correct. They are just stealing children, sending the parents to federal jail, and declaring the children ""unaccompanied alien children"", and sending them to ORR, an already-backlogged group that is supposed to find the children's nearest relatives living in the US.

ORR is the same agency that has been proven to have given children to traffickers, and straight up *lost* almost 1500 kids last year (though at least some of those may have been the kids/teens consciously deciding to lose themselves, to be fair). And even ignoring that, ORR is meant to deal with mostly teenagers, kids who are old enough to travel alone--not young kids, toddlers, and infants who are suddenly being ripped away from their parents. 

ICE and DHS are *claiming* that after the criminal proceedings are finished, they'll be reuniting the kids and parents--but they have no evidence of this, and only evidence of the kids being given to ORR, who does *not* reunite kids with parents. ICE and DHS are just lying (no surprise, given that the administration tried to lie about the policy itself).

There are advocates in Central America who are reporting that children are absolutely being deported back without their parents, after forced separation.

This is a new policy, and it's why we need to be and stay outraged, while we can still get these children back to their parents. We already have had one man commit suicide in jail after his child was stolen from him. There are many reports of agents telling parents that they will never see their children again, and lying about where they were taking them (like a group of mothers who were told their children were just being taken for a bath, and then never saw them again).

Even asylum-seekers are having their children stolen from them, though less systematically than other undocumented groups. And yes, the legal way to pursue asylum is to just show up in America--so these parents are losing their kids for doing what they're supposed to do.

And if anyone tries to pull the bullshit of ""Well they're criminals they deserve it"", unlawful entry is a **misdemeanor**. So this is like throwing everyone who is caught being drunk in public, or spraying graffiti, or trespassing, etc, into jail, and stealing their children.",comment,Philadelphia,0.0

i054xl0,"to put it bluntly, this is the least to worry about going into drugs. xylazine is a clonodine analog. clonodine itself is widely used for high blood pressure and, oddly enough, as an alternative medicine for relief from opioid withdrawals. there isn't much research on xylazine effects in humans, nor xylazine in combination with other drugs

it started to really get it's footing down in Puerto Rico in the early 2000's, and made its way up here shortly after. a medical journal [reported](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18284526/) in 2006 over a 5-month span that medical professionals detected xylazine in 7 fentanyl overdose deaths in Phiadelphia also, 6 of which also showed heroin to be present.

i say this is the least of our worries because fentanyl analogs are the real problem. xylazine is currently not a controlled substance in the U.S., and has for a long time been used in veterinary clinics on cats. ketamine, although no longer controlled, is used similarly from a practical standpoint; ketamine is currently well on it's way to becoming a useful tool to battle depression after years of research. i can speak personally on clonodine - xylazine is an analog (synthetic clonodine) so the effects are very comparable. i went to rehab once in 2011. i went with it in mind to avoid suboxone if i could, so when i brought this up to nurses, they explained clonodine to me and answered all my questions. i felt confident after everything they explained, and signed away suboxone treatment in lieu of clonodine. the effects were this: i slept for four days. i was so sleepy  i only got up to go to the bathroom or eat a snack. 

it pretty much muted my withdrawal symptoms. (my drug of choice was opiates) this is just a thought, and has no research to back it up, but from what i understand about drugs, specifically the ones being mentioned, i'd say that xylazine could go either way if used in combo with other drugs. on one hand, it lowers your blood pressure - so to does heroin and fentanyl. on the other hand - it could add some relief for addicts getting to the half-life as withdrawals come in. this, of course, is a terrible way to combat opioid withdrawal, since there is no measurement or known pharmaceutical dosage - it's street drugs after all.

which brings me to my main point – this is small potatoes compared to fentanyl analogs. xylazine being an uncontrolled substance means it's widely available in the country. fentanyl analogs are controlled, but still legal to import from China, where virtually all of the fentanyl analogs you'd find as a cutting agent in heroin are manufactured. according to investigative journalist Ben Westhoff, **80% of *all* street drugs today contain fentanyl or fentanyl anlogs.** some street drugs may be fentanyl or fsntanyl analogs entirely, despite being told it's something else. there has been a ***MASSIVE*** uptick in fake ""blues"" - 30mg roxicdone/oxycodone tablets. all someone needs is a pill press and the compounds to press together, (which can be purchased online as easily as toilet paper can be ordered from Amazon) and with a pricetag that is now well-over $1/mg for 30's, to say the fake pill industry is lucrative would be an understatement.

i implore everyone to explain to anyone they know and love struggling with opioid addiction to **only purchase drugs/medicine that you are absolutely certain came from a pharmacy.** it's a bad time right now to be addicted to opiates, truly. i'm way out of the game, but i see what's happening and the outlook is not that bright. but if we can speak the truth about drugs, maybe it will inspire people to be a littlw more careful and exercise a shred of tact.",comment,Philadelphia,1.0

itvdv2b,"&gt;Anytime a cop does something bad, the public hears about it

I find it highly unlikely that every bad act gets out. In fact, I would wager the ""thin blue line"" prevents MOST cops from reporting MOST bad acts. 

Take, for example, [the recent events in Stoughton](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2022/09/23/stoughton-police-chief-4-officers-had-inappropriate-relationships-with-young-woman-who-took-her-own-life/).

4 police officers had sexual relationships with a woman who committed suicide while pregnant last year. 

It later turns out that she was pregnant with the child of a cop who has been grooming her since she was 13, and started a sexual relationship with her when she was 15. This cop was also the last person to see her alive. 

So, if 4 cops knew and participated, then 10 cops knew. And if 10 knew, they \*all\* knew. 

Were all of the cops as bad as the 4 who had relations with her (as an adult or minor)? No. 

Did they know and do nothing? Some of them certainly. And you might call these good people, but in my book they all have blood on their hands for this.",comment,Boston,1.0

kf4njfo,"I mean, as far as I'm aware, Native Americans were the first to settle the Americas. Hence being ""native."" There's no ethical dilemma in that. The problem arises when settlers settle places where people already live. Then there is competition for land and resources and whoever has the most power wins. And whoever loses is often subject to genocide. 

I don't know what the statute of limitations is on historical rights to land, but 2000 years is a long ass time. A lot of the Jews in Israel today probably don't have a very strong connection to the region. All they have are a handful of stories. 

And again, I'm not saying that to cast judgement on anyone in particular. It's a historical inevitability. Some people will live and prosper and others will die out and suffer. That's just life. The irony being that in some people doing with their own lives what they will, massive problems arise and a lot of people suffer. It's how we get the climate crisis, banana republics, electronic manufacturers that have to set up suicide nets on their buildings and cocoa farmers who can't even afford to buy the chocolate they make.

e2s3lbb,"Wow, you got downvoted and nobody bothered to answer your question. C'mon gun owners, have a conversation!

The short answer is I don't think it's a problem on a scale that is worth intruding into the lives of gun owners with a law that doesn't actually increase safety.

The number of people who are killed or injured by guns in a house where a child finds it and uses it is tiny. Despite the hysteria of news coverage, we don't have an epidemic of children using guns inappropriately.

I'll back up my assertion with stats since I hate people who make broad claims and don't back them up. Washington State posts [detailed death statistics online](https://www.doh.wa.gov/DataandStatisticalReports/HealthStatistics/Death/DeathTablesbyTopic). [Table E4](https://www.doh.wa.gov/portals/1/Documents/5400/DeathE42015.xls) shows how many people died by firearms in 2015 (the most recent year available), whether it was a suicide, homicide, etc.

There were 714 deaths by firearm in 2015, two were accidental, 535 were suicide, and 160 were homicides. Unfortunately they don't break the numbers down by age group but I'll go out on a limb and suggest that the vast majority of 714 deaths were by people 18 and over.  Additionally a mandatory safe storage law won't stop someone who owns a gun from committing suicide: they'll just unlock their safe.

To put that number in perspective, [table E5](https://www.doh.wa.gov/portals/1/Documents/5400/DeathE42015.xls) shows the same data for deaths by poisoning. There were 1,216 total poisoning deaths in 2015, 960 of which were accidental, 206 were suicides.

Just looking at the death count, why isn't there a safe storage law for prescription medications?

Edit: I realized I didn't answer the other half of your question. I believe ERPO laws are a much better route, and Washington State has one that's been used effectively to (much to my surprise) prevent suicides.

Not all gun owners agree, but personally I like ERPO laws. They directly target specific individuals who are known to show behaviours that lead to problems involving firearms. The ERPO law in Washington State was primarily passed to help protect people in abusive relationships but it turns out [cops are using it effectively to remove guns in possible suicide situations](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/extreme-risk-seattle-police-have-seized-43-guns-from-people-deemed-to-be-a-danger-under-year-old-law/), which as the death statistics above showed is the main source of firearms fatalities in Washington State.",comment,Seattle,1.0

The idea that a bystander would attack four cops, who were at that very moment demonstrating their willingness to murder, is so absurdly suicidal (and counterproductive from the perspective of holding the police legally accountable, although that's more ""fridge logic"" and not something I would expect people to think about in the moment) that I have a very hard time believing the suggestion was genuine.",comment,Atlanta,1.0

Once you remove gang violence and intentional suicide from the mix, you have about ~500 deaths from firearms attributed to accidents, which is about 0.04% of accidental deaths in the US.

 By even the most conservative of estimates, annual defensive gun used stops ~100,000 crimes per year. The most concise study on the effects of defensive gun use pegs this number from [500,000 to in the millions](https://www.saf.org/wp-content/uploads/journals/JFPP11.pdf).",comment,Austin,1.0

dd4ejwt,"&gt; I think its even more ridiculous because then we are talking about somewhere between a quarter and a half trillion dollars for the program and that doesn't include the labor &amp; organizational costs to administer it.

I'm not claiming the gun buyback has to buy every single gun in America. That is total disarmament, which I don't support. What if it was a program that paid market price for guns up to a few hundred bucks with a cap of a few $MM to see how it affected local violence rates? Obviously, people with more expensive guns won't be trading theirs in, but I imagine it's also likely those folks are less of a threat, since they probably take gun ownership more seriously than a dude with a cheap pistol.

&gt; So it seems like your end goal is to disarm the country. How would any gun enthusiast even see this as something they would remotely consider?

Whoa, whoa now. That's not *at all* what I said. I want to reduce gun deaths. Shouldn't that be non-controversial? I'm looking for progress in lowering gun deaths, not total disarmament. Let's not beat up strawmen here when we're having a friendly discussion.

Now, you did bring up a great point: over crowded prisons. I think our prison population is a direct result of the war on drugs and privatization of prisons. In my opinion, there shouldn't be an economic reason to have more prisoners. It's just not morally OK. I think this is something we both agree on, and something I imagine many on the left would like to tackle too. If our first steps towards fewer gun deaths are to reduce nonviolent prison populations, sign me up.

Also, regarding suicide, I also think there is better public policy we could be implementing to reduce suicides that would have the effect of reducing gun deaths. I'm happy to go down that route too.

hzyfoc2,"I went through a similar situation. My freshman year was in 2015/16 and I’m just now graduating mostly because of how turbulent my mental health has been. 

Accommodations are honestly a godsend. Flexible due dates and attendance were super important for me. If I had a night where I had a panic attack or was especially suicidal, I would skip class that day. Flexible due dates also saved me when I was going through bad depressive episodes. The semester attempted suicide I was able to have two of my professors extend my deadlines into the next semester. I didn’t even know that was a possibility! I didn’t specify what crisis I was going through, but they were very accommodating. Reduced course load is another accommodation I used. It allows you to go down to part time while still getting the entirety of your grants/ loans. I medically dropped at least three classes and also only took on 9 hours for a few semesters. 

I also want to say, you will find friends who love and accept you even if you have depression. I forced myself to join an org my freshman year and I met people that I still talk to everyday. I remember how anxious and socially awkward I was at first, but then I found a couple people I’ll know for the rest of my life. I recently traveled 1554 miles to spend a weekend with three of the people I met in that org. I ended up having an extremely bad panic attack (I thought I needed to go to the hospital) and my friend sat with me and talked me through it. I told him there were times I’m college when I think just sitting with him at his apartment while he played video games saved my life. I promise you will find these people if you put yourself out there a little bit. It’s definitely hard, but it gets easier. 

For days you can’t really deal with people, but you still feel lonely–sit in a coffee shop or take the bus down to BookPeople. That was a piece of advice I learned from one of my therapists when most of my friends graduated/ were abroad. Instead of further isolation, force yourself to at least be around other people. 

I also want to say, even though it has taken me this long to graduate, none of my friends judged me for it. When I was visiting one of them recently I started tearing up when he asked what I had been up to. Most of my friends went to/ are attending top law schools and I’m just now graduating. He said, “you know, I don’t know what I’m doing either. We’re all just trying to figure it out.” And I believed him. 

Also maybe talk to a career advisor! They can probably calm your anxieties about how grades will effect your career. Recruiters know UT is a good school and they know it’s difficult. Also if you end up graduating later like I am, they won’t care because your resume will just have your graduation date and all they care about is if you got your degree.

jzn9vku,"Dependent vs. independent students on the FAFSA

  
The FAFSA considers you an independent student if you answer “yes” to any of the questions outlined in Section Three of the application:  
  
Will you be 24 or older by Jan. 1 of the school year for which you are applying for financial aid?  
Are you married or separated but not divorced?  
Will you be working toward a master’s or doctorate degree?  
Do you have children who will receive more than half of their support from you during the school year for which you are applying for financial aid?  
Do you have dependents (other than children or a spouse) who live with you and will receive more than half of their support from you during the school year for which you are applying for financial aid?  
Are you currently serving on active duty in the U.S. armed forces for purposes other than training?  
Are you a veteran of the U.S. armed forces?  
At any time since you turned age 13, were both of your parents deceased, were you in foster care or were you a ward or dependent of the court?  
Are you an emancipated minor as determined by a court?  
Are you in a legal guardianship as determined by a court?  
Are you an unaccompanied youth who is experiencing homelessness or self-supporting and at risk of experiencing homelessness, as determined by a school district homeless liaison, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-funded emergency shelter or homeless youth basic center?  
Answering yes to any of these questions makes you independent, meaning you will use only your income and assets on the FAFSA, not that of your parents.  
  
If you answered “no” to all of these questions, you’re considered dependent and will have to fill out the parent information sections of the FAFSA unless you qualify for a dependency override.

The US Department of Education has given guidance regarding situations that do and do not qualify as unusual circumstances that merit a dependency override. In particular, the following circumstances **do not** merit a dependency override, either alone or in combination:  
  
  
Parents refuse to contribute to the student’s education;  
Parents are unwilling to provide information on the application or for verification;  
Parents do not claim the student as a dependent for income tax purposes;  
Student demonstrates total self-sufficiency.  
  
What is a dependency override?  
A dependency override is a status granted by a school’s financial aid office that allows you to exclude your parent’s information from your FAFSA even if you’re originally considered dependent. This can qualify you for significantly more financial aid if your parents have income and assets that would make you ineligible.  
  
Who qualifies for a dependency override?  
The requirements to qualify for a dependency override are very strict. A dependency override may be granted if:  
  
Your parents are incarcerated.  
You left home due to an abusive family environment. (**see below for what qualifies as abuse**)  
You don’t know where your parents are (and you have not been adopted).  
You’re experiencing homelessness or at risk of experiencing homelessness and are between the ages of 21 and 24.  
Your situation will have to be verified and approved by your school’s financial aid office; the school’s decision is final and cannot be appealed.  


Dependency overrides occur in one direction, from dependent to independent. 

  
How to get a dependency override for the FAFSA  
To get a dependency override for the FAFSA, you’ll fill out the form as usual but skip Step Four and Step Five. After it’s submitted, your FAFSA won’t process; you must contact your school’s financial aid office immediately to begin the application process for the dependency override.  
  
Each school has its own documentation requirements and application steps. Documentation you may need to provide depends on the reason for your dependency override:  
  
Parents incarcerated: Documentation of parents’ incarceration, like jail records, sentencing hearing documents or an inmate registry.  
Parents’ whereabouts unknown: Police reports, missing person’s reports and signed statements from a professional third party like a landlord or former employer stating that they can’t locate your parents.  
Homelessness between age 21 and 24: Records from homeless shelters, assistance from a program like Section 8, food stamps you received on the basis of experiencing homelessness and signed statements from professionals like counselors and teachers who can verify that you’re experiencing homelessness. Remember that if a school district homeless liaison, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-funded emergency shelter or homeless youth basic center has determined that you are experiencing homelessness or at risk of experiencing homelessness, you can qualify as an independent student without applying for a dependency override.  
Abusive family: Court records, medical records, child welfare records, police reports and signed statements from professionals like former teachers, social workers and counselors. Remember that if you were in foster care for even a day after you turned 13, you can qualify as an independent student without a dependency override.

An abusive family environment is often difficult to detect, especially if the abuse is more emotional than physical. Signs of an abusive family environment include the following:  
  
Kicking children and/or a spouse out of the house.  
Violence, including physical abuse against the children or the spouse.  
Sexual abuse.  
Emotional abuse.  
Use of abusive language, including name-calling.  
Failure to properly clothe or feed the family.  
Attempts to commit suicide by one or more family members.  
One or more family members running away from home.  
Parents rejecting and ridiculing the child, controlling all outside contact with the child, keeping the child home from school for weeks or months, deliberate humiliation of the child in front of others.  
The child is abusive to others.

  
Emotional abuse is more difficult to spot, because there aren’t overt physical signs. Some of the subtle signs include:  
  
Child has difficulty in forming relationships with others or in bonding with others.  
Child is extremely shy and lacks self confidence.  
Child exhibits fatigue and listless.  
Child is routinely pessimistic.  
Self injury.  
Self-deprecating remarks.  
Reluctant to go home.  
Constantly seeking attention.  
Bullying and hostile to others.  
Ridicules others.  
Repeated truancy and tardiness.  
Grades not consistent with child’s academic ability.

fw7q3dw,"&gt;  imagine being a 3rd grader and hearing ""White people are racist, police are racist, teachers are racist. Good luck!"" Its got to have a measurable affect on depression and self-esteem, but I'm sure that its such a fucked up thing to do to children, that if anyone proposed a psychological study if it, it would be rejected (rightfully!) on ethical grounds.

I grew up in a shitty neighborhood that was about 70% Hispanic, 8% white, and 22% something else, mostly Vietnamese.

My best friend had a near 4.0 GPA and he was an Eagle Scout. He was a *million* times more motivated than I am, and really smart. I was your typical white autist, semi-smart but crippled by apathy and laziness and irresponsibility.

Fast forward 30 years:

My best friend used to mow lawns for a living, but now works in a warehouse moving packages around.

The only discernible difference between me and my best friend, was that my best friend was *constantly* being told:

* he was worthless

* studying is for pussies

* only fools get a J-O-B, all the ""cool kids"" sell drugs, steal shit, and chase pussy

* There's no point in trying to succeed, because the entire system is stacked against you

It's interesting that in 2020, all of this has become institutionalized. That we send teenagers off to college, where they're taught that America is inherently broken, despite the fact that this ""broken"" country is where *everyone*, all over the world, wants to live in.

And if you dare to raise your voice, and say *""hey guys, maybe America really isn't the worst place in the entire world""*, you're **immediately** branded as a Nazi / White Supremacist / Alt Right / Conservative / Republican / Christian / Boomer / Fox News viewer.

We've reached a point where the only acceptable opinion is that ""America sucks"" and ""it must be destroyed.""

l6gngfa,"Hi it’s your friendly local therapist with some information that may be helpful for those that struggle with depression, anxiety, substance use concerns, or anyone looking to just improve overall mental health. Most people know that exercise is good for their physical health, but did you know about all of the benefits that it can provide your mental health?
DEPRESSION
* Regular exercise can significantly reduce the symptoms of mild to moderate depression
* Exercise can even prevent the onset or recurrence of depression symptoms 
* Exercise can be helpful to counteract the weight gain that may come from certain antidepressant (SSRIs etc.) medications
ANXIETY
* Regular exercise can significantly reduce the symptoms of anxiety 
* Regular exercise can serve as a healthy form of exposure to symptoms of panic attacks such as increased heart rate and sweating. Doing so can help you become more comfortable and familiar with symptoms you may perceive as dangerous or frightening 
SUBSTANCE USE
* Regular exercise can reduce cravings for substances 
* Exercise has been shown to reduce relapse in those in recovery 
* Exercise can provide a healthy replacement for time that had previously been occupied by drug use 

Additionally, exercise has been shown to improve sleep, reduce the rate of cognitive decline in aging, and improve mood. 

Many of my patients express a desire to incorporate exercise into their routine but some common barriers present themselves
* ‘I am not sure how to exercise.’ Even very moderate exercise has been shown to have benefits. While higher intensity exercise has increased benefits, even walking for 30 minutes a day three times a week provides benefits
* ‘I don’t have time to exercise.’ Many times it is less a question of time and more a question of priority (obviously there are always outliers). Some ways to counteract this is to incorporate physical activity into daily routine (take stairs instead of elevator, park in back of parking lot.) additionally, the recommended daily 30 minutes of exercise can be broken down into chunks (3 sessions of 10 minutes each etc.)
* ‘I don’t have the motivation to exercise.’ Sometimes it can be helpful to incorporate exercise into an activity you enjoy. For example if you enjoy photography, take your camera out on a hiking trail and take photos as you go
* ‘I always forget to exercise.’ Prior to a routine being established it can be difficult to remember to exercise. Sometimes tying it to a daily event can be helpful (I will take a 15 minute walk after dinner etc.) additionally, setting alarms on your phone or leaving sticky notes somewhere you look everyday (fridge, bathroom mirror) can be helpful 

Sorry for the wall of text, but I feel so strongly about this topic. Physical exercise is one of the cornerstones of my mental health and many of my patients have reported better functioning and increased mental health outcomes when they incorporate exercise into their daily life.

Homelessness is often a symptom of other problems.

cjybj6d,"&gt;**Myths and Realities of Female-Perpetrated Terrorism**

&gt;*Karen Jacques and Paul J. Taylor*    
&gt;*Lancaster University*

&gt;The authors examined the backgrounds and social experiences of female terrorists to test conflicting accounts of the etiology of this offending group. Data on 222 female terrorists and 269 male terrorists were examined across 8 variables: age at first involvement, educational achievement, employment status, immigration status, marital status, religious conversion, criminal activity, and activist connections. The
majority of female terrorists were found to be single, young (35 years old), native, employed, educated to at least secondary level, and rarely involved in criminality. Compared with their male counterparts,
female terrorists were equivalent in age, immigration profile, and role played in terrorism, **but they were more likely to have a higher education attainment, less likely to be employed, and less likely to have prior activist connections**. The results clarify the myths and realities of female-perpetrated terrorism and suggest that the risk factors associated with female involvement are distinct from those associated with male involvement.

And if you're not interested in reading a white paper:

&gt;The Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Project conducted public opinion surveys in February 2004 in Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, and Turkey, involving about 1,000 respondents in each country. One of the questions asked was, “What about suicide bombing carried out against Americans and other Westerners in Iraq? Do you personally believe that this is justifiable or not justifiable?” Pew kindly provided me with tab­ulations of these data by respondents’ personal characteristics.

&gt;The clear finding was that people with a higher level of education are in general more likely to say that suicide attacks against Westerners in Iraq are justified. I have also broken this pattern down by income level. There is no indication that people with higher incomes are less likely to say that sui­cide-bombing attacks are justified.

&gt;Another source of opinion data is the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, headquar­tered in Ramallah. The center collects data in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. One question, asked in December 2001 of 1,300 adults, addressed attitudes toward armed attacks on Israeli tar­gets. Options were “strongly support,” “support,” “oppose,” “strongly oppose,” or “no opinion.”

&gt;Support turned out to be stronger among those with a higher level of education. For exam­ple, while 26 percent of illiterates and 18 per­cent of those with only an elementary education opposed or strongly opposed armed attacks, the figure for those with a high school education was just 12 percent. The least supportive group turned out to be the unemployed, 74 percent of whom said they support or strongly back armed attacks. By comparison, the support level for merchants and professionals was 87 percent.

lb7nhbp,"Pursuing acting as a career? I'm going to assume you don't have any connections here, otherwise, you'd be asking them.

The best way to get into acting, if you have no connections, is to intern. If you're not in college, or don't have a degree, you're going to have incredible difficulty finding any sort of income. Good luck paying rent, food, and car insurance on an Uber driver's wage.

Your competition is people whom have been working on professional shoots since childhood. People whom are related to top talent, producers, and agents, as well as friends of people whom are related to top talent and producers and agents. People whom spent decades working as Production crew and made connections. People whom have interned for talent agencies, booking agencies and casting agencies. Many these people will be incredibly attractive and incredibly talented. **What are you bringing to the table that would make someone want to cast you over them?**

People in your situation, if reading the comments are correct (uneducated, unemployed, zero connections), if lucky, end up as professional SAG background actors, and if REALLY lucky, stand-ins, and make up to 40k-50k a year.  For reference, if you want to live in an apartment by yourself, you probably need to make 80k, minimum. If you're not lucky (not even unlucky), you end up working at Target or a grocery store for the rest of your life.

Also note, the chances of making a livable wage as an entertainer, even with connections (even being related to an A-lister), having a formal acting education, and having money and time to hone your skills, is extraordinarily low. Extraordinarily low. Where does that put you?

Go to school. Get a degree, so at the very least, you can come out to L.A. with internship opportunities and a piece of paper that tells potential employers that you can make good decisions, and try to work your way in front of the camera by working for people whom can help you reach that goal.

Right now, you're just a weak, ignorant, poor, one in a million hopeful, that will be a target for every predator in this city of 4 million. You have no skills. You have no power. You have no connections. All you have are stars in your eyes, and those are worthless to you, but worth lots to those who will take advantage of your naivety.

What is your game plan? Do you have one? If you just plan on showing up and seeing how things go, you're going to fail. You need a road map. You need to be prepared. You need to know how to overcome not only the obstacles I've listed, but the ones that no one can predict.

How are you going to convince an adult to rent a room to an 18 year old unemployed wannabe actor? How are you going to get a normal job to pay rent, when your resume pales in comparison to any college graduate that came out to be an actor? 

How do you expect to compete?

1kkgal,"An email I* just received from my pawpaw about the varsity. &gt; &gt; Great Story about taking chances and hard work - The Varsity in Atlanta&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The first Varsity opened 84 years ago. You have probably eaten there at 
&gt; &gt; least once, maybe many times, it is an Atlanta landmark. Daily around 15,000 people eat at one of the five Varsity restaurants in and
&gt; &gt; around Atlanta and when there is a Georgia Tech home game, 30,000 usually eat just at the downtown location.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Do you know the history of the Varsity Restaurants, the myths, the facts, and the food?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Founder, Frank Gordy graduated from Reinhardt University in 1925, then continued his studies at Georgia Tech.
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, he didn't do so well. One day his professor told him 
&gt; &gt; that he was not passing, and ""maybe you should give up and open a hot dog stand."" He told him ""I think I'll do just that and get rich right under your nose!""
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For the next two years, Gordy, who always liked challenges, saved his money and in 1927, he opened that hot dog
&gt; &gt; stand with his nest egg of $2,000. He knew that cheap food and students go together and Georgia Tech students Swarmed
&gt; &gt; his restaurant, then named The Yellow Jacket Inn. The first day he made $49.50. Soon Gordy outgrew the Hemphill and
&gt; &gt; Luckie Street location and opened a new restaurant at the present location
&gt; &gt; of 61 North Avenue. It was now 1928.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Gordy dreamed of opening hot dog stands at college campuses all over Georgia, but he had a problem with the original name,
&gt; &gt; The Yellow Jacket Inn which was highly associated with Georgia Tech. There was a popular song at the time, The Varsity
&gt; &gt; Drag and he decided that would be a great name for his future chain of restaurants. The Varsity was born.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is now 1932, the Great Depression, not many businesses were opening or expanding, but the self-made entrepreneur,
&gt; &gt; Gordy, decides to gamble on his dream and open another Varsity, near the
&gt; &gt; campus of the University of Georgia in Athens.
&gt; &gt; Eighty years later it is still thriving. Today there are five locations,
&gt; &gt; downtown Atlanta, Athens, Alpharetta, Gwinnett Town Center, and Dawsonville.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In all of its 84 years, the Varsity restaurants have only been closed 
&gt; &gt; one day and it was in June, 1983, the day
&gt; &gt; Frank Gordy was buried. He managed his restaurants for 55 years.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Several of the famous employees of the Varsity are Erby Walker with his signature phrase, ""Have your money out and your
&gt; &gt; food in mind And I'll get you to the game on time."" Walker worked seven days a week Up to 100 hours a week to support his large family. He retired in 2003, and three weeks later he came back to work. He also worked at the Varsity for 55 years.
&gt; &gt; He started when he was 15 years old. Another employee was Flossie Mae, their most famous curbman who would sing the menu and
&gt; &gt; dance along the line of cars. He worked into his 80's and was equally
&gt; &gt; famous for his headgear that changed almost daily.
&gt; &gt; Nipsey Russell also began as a Varsity curbman where he honed his future
&gt; &gt; comedic skills. He was simply known as curbman #46.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Coca-Cola and the Varsity have had a long history. You can see the Coke headquarters building from the parking lot of the
&gt; &gt; Varsity. There Is a rumor that a pipe underneath the street brings Coca-Cola directly from the Coke headquarters to the
&gt; &gt; Varsity counter. Gordy's grandson, the manager of the downtown restaurant,
&gt; &gt; said that once the Varsity was almost out of Coke and they called the headquarters. Coke employees went to their own cafeteria, got Cokes and brought them to the Varsity.
&gt; &gt; When Coke's number one stockholder, Warren Buffett, visited Atlanta, the
&gt; &gt; first place that Coke executives took him was the Varsity for lunch. The Varsity sells more Coke products than any other place on earth with more than 2,000,000 cups sold annually.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The first Varsity on North Avenue occupied a 70 X 190 foot lot with a white picket fence surrounding their cinder parking lot.
&gt; &gt; Originally it was a drive-in only, but soon business demanded a sit-down restaurant. Today, the building, drive-in and parking
&gt; &gt; lots occupy two acres. When the I-75/85 connector was built, 
&gt; &gt; construction
&gt; &gt; took the entire west parking lot. Gordy had a multi-level parking lot built to hold up to 600 cars. The restaurant can seat 800 customers. The downtown Varsity holds the record as the
&gt; &gt; largest drive-in in the world.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Here are some amazing facts about the Varsity: Each day 2 miles of hot 
&gt; &gt; dogs are served, just at the downtown location. The hot dogs are especially made just for the Varsity. Every day they cook two tons 
&gt; &gt; of onions, 15,000 hamburgers, two and a half tons of potatoes.
&gt; &gt; Delivery trucks deliver 3-6 times a day and that is just for meat and 
&gt; &gt; buns, the last fresh buns are delivered at 1 a.m. Around 300 gallons of chili are prepared daily, 50 gallons at a time All this food is cooked and served by 200 employees at the downtown's 145
&gt; &gt; foot counter.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is one of Atlanta's top grossing restaurants with almost ten 
&gt; &gt; million in sales annually and that is made with hotdogs, hamburgers,
&gt; &gt; onion rings and french fries costing less than $2 each. The
&gt; &gt; piece-de-resistance at the Varsity is their marriage of peaches or 
&gt; &gt; apples and sugar, placed in round pieces of dough and fried to a golden brown.
&gt; &gt; 5,000 of these pies are made daily.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The most popular meal ordered is the #1 which consists of two chili 
&gt; &gt; dogs, an order of french fries or onion rings and a regular drink. The Varsity only sells sweet tea. A unique Varsity drink is the FO, frosted orange, an orange-flavored milkshake and tastes similar to a Dreamsicle.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The Varsity Lingo is also famous, the naked dog, a hotdog on a bun, the heavyweight, a hotdog with extra chili, and if you order a hot dog, it will have chili and mustard on the bun, a bag of rags is potato chips and
&gt; &gt; on and on.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; According to Frank Gordy's grandson, his grandfather loved technology and
&gt; &gt; bought a television for the restaurant dining room as soon as
&gt; &gt; they were available to the public. Some Atlantans say the first time they ever saw a television was at the Varsity. There are five dining rooms at the Varsity with television sets on different channels. Each election, TV camera crews arrive to interview diners as they watch election coverage. Presidents to local politicians make a path to the
&gt; &gt; Varsity to eat and meet voters.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Once, founder, Frank Gordy was asked what happened to the leftovers, he
&gt; &gt; responded, ""What leftovers?",submission,Atlanta,1.0

gwgse9u,"&gt; However, I want to be clear that the key word in the quote is **all**. 

Yeah, totally. I hope it didn't come off as attacking your post in particular. It seemed like you were putting plenty of blame on him as well - maybe I should have saved the comment for one of the many people who can excuse his immense struggles with one Kadri hit.

That being said, I don't feel the same way about the asks here. He's been asked to play on his offwing with a top NHL center. An ask tons of players in this league would die for. Still he doesn't bring compete. I've honestly never been enamored with him, thus I don't really expect him to put up 20 goals a year. I'd rather him put up 15 and be a rounded player. I also consider myself fairly lenient on the fact that these guys are human and have emotions. I still can't dig up anymore excuses for the guy. Maybe the first healthy scratch. Maybe the first rough patch. But it's year in and year out. I just want the dude to put the effort in. I know playing your offwing isn't trivial. I know it's hard. But if you can't do it, and you can't really justify playing over someone else on your natural wing, I don't have much sympathy for you.

What you describe as the cycle is pretty much all Cassidy can do. What other actions does he have outside of what you said, put him on LW (which like I said, get Ritchie the fuck out of here) and pray it works... slightly better when it hasn't exactly lit the world on fire in the past. He's put him on the PP, he's put him with his long time center, he's put him with other struggling players, he's put him with a faster compliment winger, he's put him with a bruiser. None of that worked so he scratched him to motivate him, which has worked in the past, and that only lasts a while. There are players that'd die for this kind of rope.

Even having said that I'm not a huge Cassidy guy. My mentioning of Heinen is an example of that. I loved watching him play and having a cheap dude that can fit in anywhere is super valuable. He was basically pt per game player his for 40 games in the NHL. He did the same thing in a \~15 game stretch playing with Marchand and Bergeron. The team couldn't get depth scoring yet Cassidy didn't try shit with that. At the end of the day, Heinen wasn't providing pt production, which the team needed, so he's gone. Hard to be upset about a guy who can't even avoid getting scratched by the fucking Ducks. But, if Heinen was given half the leash DeBrusk was who knows what he'd produce. Especially given he was part of the B's best 5 on 5 line in the '19 run. If Kuhlman is given a run on the 4th, maybe he can carve a niche against faster teams. Beyond that, the repeated ice time for terrible skaters against agile teams drives me nuts. Cassidy has me scratching my head all the time, but the one who gets more chances than anyone has to be DeBrusk.

And I can blame the front office without taking any blame away from DeBrusk. I personally would have been okay moving him over a year ago but would have admitted he had potential to do well elsewhere. This sub would certainly have lost their mind, as would most fans. Who knows what the return would have been this year. It just feels fruitless to head in that direction.

It could be that you're right, they put him on the LW on the 2nd or 3rd line and he puts like 0.5 pts a game and that's all he needed. He could be dealing with pandemic depression. He could have gotten shot down by some chick he was into for all we know. 100% to each their own but I personally feel like the organization has done quite a lot and given him more rope than he should need to.",comment,Boston,1.0

The same Herbert Hoover who stood by and did *nothing* as America lurched into the Great Depression. So I don't consider an obviously ideological author to be an objective assessor of the facts. 

And the [Construction Industry Research Board collects such objective facts](https://wordpressstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/wp-media/wp-content/uploads/sites/833/2019/07/CIRB-Historical-Data-1954-2019.pdf). And the facts are this: After rent control was implemented and before Costa Hawkins, California on average built 170,000 units. After costa-hawkins, it was 117,000 units a year, and only twice, during the housing bubble in the aughts did construction exceed 200,000 units a year compared to 78-95 where seven years cleared 200,000 and even had the second highest year in 1986.

Since 2006 we've averaged a little under one a year. There will be another one. It may be a criminal or it may be a mentally disturbed person. No way to know. But there will be another one.

And nothing on either the Mental Health front or a ""Temporary Extreme Risk"" front will have been done. But at least they aren't commin' fer yer guns! ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ ",comment,Seattle,1.0

People are furious.  This summer will be a real breaking point.

jqoehag,"If I were to get pregnant in Texas, I would leave.  If I could not afford an abortion or safe access, I would leave.    The laws favor the child over the mother’s wife if something goes wrong, and depending on the child, and my understanding is that indeed she would be forced to go to term and give birth to a dead or terribly disfigured baby if something went sideways or she could be charged with a felony.

I would 100% **go to a women’s sub and ask this**.   **Which responses are upvoted hte most will primarily reflect the opinions of young white men and they just do not know much about pregnancy and the risks**  (POC women are at even higher risk for pregnancy complications due to medical systems systemic racism, which we make progress in but is still very much there.  This may or may not apply to you and something you should consider)

&#x200B;

I’m absolutely *terrified* of getting pregnant here.  My doctor wants me to change meds that work perfectly well for my epilepsy because it might damage a baby if I were to get pregnant.  I never want to get pregnant and do not want children.  I use protection but it’s not 100% guaranteed and that’s very, very scary.  If there’s even 0.01% I’d get pregnant and have a child and not have access to abortion, I would not want penetrative sex.  It’s not worth ruining my entire life over and putting myself at risk for some pretty terrible things considering particular Texas laws.

&#x200B;

The doctors themselves may be wonderful and want to do what is right but are constricted by law and don’t want to go to prison or lose their license themselves.

Please please please **go to a women’s sub for parents or pregnant women, explain you’re a man and ask there or you are not getting proper info and feedback.**  **She needs to know from actual women who experience this what she needs to worry about and what could go wrong**, because things could go very seriously wrong and her life could be at risk.

iuw7vnd,"Fun fact, Dr. Suzanne Black was my therapist (not in Austin though), she helped me get diagnosed and on medication and now my life is better than ever. 

I did bring up this graffiti in one of our first sessions, I lived in Austin before so found it a funny coincidence (I found these reddit posts while googling her name). Basically the guy writing all this crap is schizophrenic and his ex girlfriend died, I think from a drug overdose or suicide? And Suzanne had been her therapist before then, she never lived in Austin or worked for Seton though. Since the gf died the schizophrenic bf believed she had been hypnotized and it was Suzanne's fault even though she doesn't practice hypnotherapy or work in Austin at all. There were lawsuits and the guy went to prison but is apparently out if this is starting again.

I know Dr. Black went through hell with this but it's really a guy with severe mental illness trying to deal with severe grief and looking for someone to blame. But I can vouch that Dr. Suzanne Black is a great therapist and no, she does not do hypnotherapy nor kill people - in fact she pretty much saved mine.",comment,Austin,1.0
d6xgq48,"I went to grad school at Central Washington University. After living in Ellensburg for two years, I don't wonder at all why it hasn't filled up.

Ellensburg is a quaint little town that gets old after a few weeks. It was also probably my favorite town in the area. Yakima is a depressing city. I understood it to have a lot of gang problems too, though I can't confirm that. Wenatchee was just okay. There wasn't much to speak of about it either way.

It's pretty there, in its own way, but Central Washington is *very* dry. I got nosebleeds there a lot.  

The Yakima River runs through the area, but there really weren't any good places I found to go enjoy it - at least not in Ellensburg. Even if you did, the summer winds ruined any outside time. I don't think I can explain how pervasive and unrelenting the winds were.

Seattle is about 90 minutes away from Ellensburg - in the Summer. In the winter, if there's snow in Snowqualmie Pass, good luck. We once aborted a drive there by the time we got to Cle Ellum, just 15 minutes west of Ellensburg. It would have taken at least half a day to get to Seattle.

I don't mean to rag on Central Washington too much. Yakima Valley wines are pretty good. It's a lot closer to the Gorge Amphitheater than we are. Maybe the cities have gotten a bit more culture in the 12 years since I left. However, all the things that people love about living in Portland, they're just not there. Heck, it's not even like Bend. At least Bend has good mountains for hiking and skiing, breweries, and river activities on the Deschutes.",comment,Portland,1.0
fszy4na,"&gt; How very Kensyian of you. Let's pour cash into the system, the worst that happens is the system has more cash! That's essentially the argument you are making. ""Spending Power"" is more like ""market distortion power"" when it is just cash infused with no productivity attached.

Yeah it's Kensyian, it's the economic philosophy that got us out of the Great Depression. Which yah know is the most comparable economic event to right now. The most immediate risk to our economy isn't inflation it's workers losing their homes and not feeding their families. If we want to talk about cash with no productivity attached then the 2017 tax cuts were disgusting in that regard. At least expanded UI benefits cause workers to spend money, those tax cuts allowed corporations to buy back all their stock and sit on that money. Not using it, not letting it flow through the economy just obscenely increasing the wealth of people who already had several lifetimes of wealth. If you want to roll back those tax cuts and increase taxes on the wealthy it'd be way more effective at keeping money flowing in our economy and I'm all for it. But the GOP aren't.

&gt; You can never know. I would contend it is no more dangerous now for your average worker than a year ago today at least in terms of the virus. In fact, far less traffic so may even be net safer for your typical 25-55 year old worker. No reason they can't go back to work.

I didn't say they shouldn't go back to work, I said it should be done safely. Cutting UI and say fuck you go back to work and roll the dice is treating human beings as wage slaves who's health is irrelevant. I mean it when I say we need more time to be sure, that's what science says. We don't have a cure and the decline in cases only came about when we shut down everything for three months. Now I would prefer to open slowly keeping up testing capabilities and monitoring for spikes. Part of that is keeping workers on UI for longer so people can come back to work slowly. Not forever, but we should be smarter about the phase out than just a hard cutoff.

&gt; Hey I have a 3rd way, we have no idea what the effects of this stimulus will be thus choosing either of your moral choices is silly. We don't even know if it helped the people it was supposed to yet. Again, that will take economists YEARS to figure out. It will be quite interesting to watch it be studied to be honest.

There are long term economic effects but there are also short term ones. Ones affecting our lives right now and ones we can solve. If every government intervention was met with ""well we don't know how it will play out for a few years so we shouldn't do it"" then the government would be impotent. Corporate power would dominate and we'd just slide into neo-feudalism. Government power should be used when there's no market incentive to improve peoples lives.",comment,Chicago,0.0

h6l77uj,"I’m so late to the party but had to chip in being the vain being I am! 

Do not live in a basement apartment. (Which I see you’ve made the choice) I’ve lived in two temporarily and will never do so again unless I need to.

Pros: it’s cheaper (basement could save at least $200-$300 a month just in rent compared to a 1 Bd. That’s thousands of dollars a year). 

-Basements are also generally a couple degrees more cooler in the summer which I liked - So if the house is set at 73, it’ll be 71 in the basement. This is important because most basement apartments don’t have a separate HVAC thermostat. Even in apartments I’ve felt hot in my bedroom and needed a fan with the air on, but never in a basement. 

Cons: the noise, oh god the noise! If you have different schedules from the landlord or family or other tenants above you, god help you. You can hear footsteps, thumping, banging, talking, dogs barking (if they have one) etc. it was horrible. Some basement soundproofing are worse than others, so if you can, definitely investigate and test it out. Some people could hear their landlords phone vibrate or anytime the opened/closed the fridge. I made sure that that I was renting from two single ladies over 50. An even then it was still bad. Just make sure it’s not a family with a toddler. It’s Horrible. I’m telling you. 

Another big con is the natural light situation which is nearly nonexistent. Both my basements had no windows and only one patio door to open that didn’t bring much natural light and helped only a little for fresh air. And if there was no sun during the day I’d have to turn on all the lights as if it was nighttime already. Could be very depressing sometimes.

Could be humid sometimes if you are in a humid area which would be unpleasant. A dehumidifier can go a long way. 

Smell lingers a longtime especially due to poor ventilation, so cooking eggs and bacon could even be unpleasant and can get very smokey. 

High risk of more damage due to possible flooding; even minor dampness could cause problems. 

Higher risk of pests breaking into home through the basement first as it is the first level of entry for ground animals.

I moved to New York about a year ago and I've been struggling to find my ""place"" here in the big city. I currently work as a product manager in tech, but previously I was working as a full-time musician for a few years.

My day job is fully remote, and to get out of the house, I've been working at a co-working space in Manhattan. I was really hoping to be able to make some new friends through the co-working space, but it seems that everyone at the space is just interested in getting work done and leaving.

So, I was wondering if you all might be able to recommend a space that:

1. is somewhat social... maybe even hosts events sometimes?
2. would have a good mix of creatives and entrepreneurs at the space
3. and last, but probably most important, a space where people would be there *during* *the evenings.*

To the Georgia State community,

We are saddened today by the tragic death of a Georgia State student by suicide. Some members of our community witnessed this terrible tragedy in front of 25 Park Place, at the heart of our campus, Thursday afternoon.

This public act was deeply troubling. Our thoughts and prayers are with the young man’s family, and with those who are deeply affected by his death. I encourage students affected by this tragedy to reach out to our Georgia State Counseling and Testing Center at 404-413-1640. Faculty and staff can call 404-413-3357 for crisis assistance. These resources are always available to assist members of our community.

Let’s join together as the Georgia State community and continue to support one another in this time of tragic loss.

cgthvg4,"&gt; So being depressed is a mental illness then? If so, depressed people can be assholes. Just because you are depressed does not give you an excuse to ruin other people's lives. It still makes you an asshole.

Right, severely depressed people who finally crumble under their baggage set out, with a clear head, to make the lives of others miserable. Your understanding of mental illness is impeccable!

Maybe that's what I should have told my schizophrenic/depressed mother! Instead of just leaving her alone and recognizing that she was out of her damn mind, I should have called her an asshole for screaming at me after I interrupted her conversation with two people who don't exist! I should have done the same after she shoveled pills down her throat and had to go to the hospital! ""Fuck you asshole, I have basketball practice tomorrow!"" Obviously she had set out with a clear mind to make my life hell. What an asshole!

Where I come from it's common knowledge that mentally ill people have subpar, even poor, sometimes horrendous, control over their actions and thoughts. Clearly that's not the case in a classist shitbox like Texas though.

&gt; Hell, we still have no idea why she did it. You cannot just say that if someone commits suicide that they have a mental illness.

Get the fuck out of here. Yeah, I'm sure she just came skipping out of her home this morning and thought it was a FINE day to jump off a highway overpass for the lulz!

You're probably one of those dudebros that prides themselves on being normal and has zero experience with mental problems, but still likes to put on the Dr. Phil cap anyway and present yourself as an expert on them because ego.

ejzuloi,"I think Lightfoot is the reasonable choice for reform though. #StopLightfoot was built largely off of taking the police board under a microscope and picking out its worst moments.

The fact is, at a time when it looked like political suicide, Lori Lightfoot stepped up and was willing to take on the task of reforming the CPD.  Under her watch, the Police Board dramatically increased the number of recommendations for officers to be fired for misconduct.

It's really easy to sit on the sidelines and pick apart every single case when dealing with something as controversial as police misconduct.  But willingly putting your hat into the ring to take on the issue head-on at a time when you are certain to get intense amounts of heat from both sides of the aisle takes balls and conviction to actually solving the problem.

The results speak for themselves much better than activists picking apart every individual case do.

k3vh350,"You must be kidding. Visitors smuggle drugs all the time via the visiting floor and inmates also are getting a lot of drugs through the mail. I was visiting a friend of mine over the summer who was in Rikers(thankfully his case was thrown out) and I can tell you they have been doing everything they can short of an actual strip search to make sure visitors aren't bringing in any drugs. They scan your hands and even if a tiny bit of THC residue that can't be seen by the naked eye pops up positive they deny your visit or you get a non contact visit. They bring K9 sniffing dogs before you go on your visit. Then right before you see your visitor they do pat down searches over your clothes, check the waistband of your pants, shake out your shoes, if you have a baby with you they check the baby bottles and check to make sure nothing is in the baby's diaper. So short of literally making an adult strip down to nothing they do all that is allowed, I can't count how many metal detectors I went through before I made it to my friends building.

efj6l0b,"This is gonna be TL:DR but I’m gonna answer your questions legitimately.

Chiro itself is legitimate. I get adjusted and when I find a new job I’ll keep getting adjusted because it does help with my general well being.

Chiropractors are doctors of chiropractic. They can’t prescribe medications like an MD, but you wouldn’t want them to. The hours of schooling they get is on par with a doctor. The difference is how their hours are spent. A chiropractor spends more hours in anatomy, diagnosis, neurology, radiology and a medical doctor spends more time in chemistry, pathology, psychiatry, and obstetrics. There’s more course work where their hours overlap. But where doctors go to do stuff like pharmacology and surgery, chiropractors do spinal manipulation and advanced radiology. The hours it takes to be an MD or a chiropractor are comparable - some +4200 to +4400 hours.

I have my own opinion of supplements and homeopathy. But let me answer your question first. The idea behind chiropractic is that the body can heal itself when you don’t have subluxations (basically small misalignments of the vertebrae that impair the nerve flow to the body). Since they are anti Big Pharma, things from the ground, eating well and taking supplements to give the body need nutrients help keep you healthy.

Okay. My opinion. I take medications. I have chronic severe depression, migraines, and an intractable tension headache. I take 3 big medications because fuck herbs and minerals. My brain needs chemical help. I was suicidal and once we got my meds balanced, I am a functioning adult person. Supplements DO help when you have a proven need. For instance, if you’re anemic, iron supplements are a thing that helps. There are real reasons to take supplements, because herbalism is founded in science. And frankly, a lot of those “old wives tales” work because there is science behind using certain herbs or minerals to treat problems. There are real reasons to take prescription meds too though and sorry not sorry, 3 prescriptions did what some 20 supplements couldn’t.

Okay. Homeopathy. With the exception of one local guy who harvests pollen off plants and makes a tincture to help boost immunity to the allergen (it works in the same way that taking raw local honey does) and calls his product homeopathic (it’s not, it’s a form of herbalism), homeopathy is a snake oil shit show. Homeopathy is based on the idea that water retains a memory of what was in it. So whatever good was in there is so diluted down that it’s 0.000howmanyever0000001% of the original product. But the “water remembers” so it’s like you’re getting it at full strength. That’s so much bullshit. Like, if water remembered what was in it, we would never drink water again. +flush+ So yeah, homeopathy is full of shit.

When you get adjusted, the chiropractor is using specific techniques to adjust subluxations of the spine. A subluxation is a misalignment. For me, when I get a migraine, my C2 (cervical vertebrae 2 - second bone down from my head in my neck) gets shifted, that causes muscles to tense, and also causes nerve pain. Getting adjusted shifts the C2 off the nerves, allows the muscles to relax a little and the nerves to calm down. Does that mean my migraine goes away? No. It does mean it goes from a 9/10 to a 7/10 and allows my rescue meds to work and bring it to a 3/10. So, for me, it’s another tool at my disposal. Since my rescue meds can only be taken every 6 hours and only for 3 days or fuck you liver, fuck you stomach lining, getting the pain down to a manageable level is crucial. My pain killer alone will take the migraine from a 9/10 to a 6/10. That’s.... not great. So if I can get adjusted and give the meds better odds, I mean... yeah.

For other people who suffer from back pain, typically they have degeneration in their spine and the adjustments help make the spine more mobile, which in turn prevents more degeneration and more pain. It can also correct mild to moderate scoliosis and other issues with spinal curvature. Generally speaking, if you find a chiropractor who is taking X-Rays and is actually into chiropractic and not all the other shit - Applied Kinesiology is a total scam for instance - then you’re pretty safe. If the chiropractor is just adjusting people without taking X-Rays? I’d be wary. The chiropractor I work for is a good chiropractor, except that they’re totally antivax and I genuinely can’t believe that with how grounded in science they are with every other part of their practice, they don’t believe in herd immunity. That just blows my mind.

But anyway. I hope that helps answer your questions as someone who both sees a chiropractor because I believe that when given the chance the body can fix a lot of stuff but who believes that vaccines are important and prescription medicines also have an important role, and the two practices should be able to coexist without hate. My stance is, I’ll try chiropractic first, because if I can avoid an extra prescription or a surgery, that is my preference. But if in a reasonable amount of time, I’m not seeing results, I’m going to my PCP.  So far that’s worked well for me, and I’ve avoided needing regular antibiotics for sinus infections because of getting adjusted (immune system works better because nervous system works better means I fight off common cold easier than I used to), but when I had the flu you better believe I was at my doctor asking for Tamiflu and not at the chiropractor getting adjusted. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",comment,Austin,1.0

l6disqf,"I don't think you understand the argument about providing housing for the homeless.

Obviously, at this point they need to be institutionalized for the safety of themselves and others. Tweakers on the street need to be put into rehab.

But the point is - they didn't **start** that way. At one point many of these folks were regular citizens, who had regular lives. Something happened - maybe they were born with a mental illness, maybe they developed one, maybe they became disabled, maybe they tried drugs from a friend once and it sent them into a spiral of addiction until they couldn't maintain a home or a job. Maybe they were arrested for something minor (or maybe were falsely accused of something they didn't even do - wrong place, wrong time), couldn't afford bail, missed work while they waited on their trial, got fired, and then got evicted.

But in all those cases - clearly they had no support structure, forcing them to live on the street. And once you're on the street, it's a lot harder to get by. There's no safe place to store your belongings, so over time they get lost/stolen. Without a mailing address, it's harder to convince a job to hire you.

And it's not like everyone doing drugs on the street was always a tweaker. [Per the LA Times:](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-10-04/homelessness-drugs-addiction-encampments-substance-abuse-unhoused-police)

> For those who did use drugs in the last six months, 40% of people started using — more than 3 times a week —after becoming homeless. Thirty-one percent of those individuals reported using methamphetamine and 11% used nonprescription opioids more than three times per week. Those who spent most of their nights unsheltered in a non-vehicle (sleeping outside, in tents, in places not meant for human habitation) and individuals who were homeless for more than a year had higher proportions of methamphetamine and opioid use.

> The California Statewide Study also conducted interviews with more than 300 homeless adults, exploring their daily life, including drug use. That work, along with other research, finds that individuals frequently use methamphetamine to help them stay awake at night to protect themselves and their property from assault and theft.

> People also report using drugs to cope with depression, anxiety and the trauma of being homeless.

It's this self-perpetuating cycle where one mistake or missed paycheck spirals into a system where you can't climb out on your own, and there's no support network to help you. Then many people crack under the stress of being homeless and not knowing how to get their next meal, or they become addicts _as a result_ of living on the streets.

The point of public housing is to **prevent** this situation from happening. Giving a safety net to _everyone_ to fall back on - including yourself, if you ever found yourself in hard times - can help people get the safety net that they need and ensure that they **don't** become like this.

Of course those sorts of housing projects can't cure mental illness. But they can sure prevent it.",comment,LosAngeles,1.0

It's the teachers accepting no raise in several contracts over the last 20 years accumulating in the hundreds of millions over time in pay that they didn't get but again, most teachers aren't upset about how much they are paid. It's a nurse one out of five days, an engineer to fix things one out of five things, it's more than one councilor or social worker for 300 kids, it's school buildings that are 50  years old with no upkeep, it's more and more and more testing, grade schools take nearly 30 standardized tests per year now. And that's not the teachers coming up with this, it's the 5 layers of admin bureaucracy coming up with that. Teachers bear all the brunt of terrible management and get nothing in return but scorn from people like you. But please tell me more about what you know about Chicago Public Schools and how it operates? Have you taught somewhere in the city? Have you ever even been to certain parts of the city? Or do you watch the news and think you have the full picture? Why do you hate teachers so much? So many work so hard and give of themselves and suffer, suicide among CPS teachers is a real thing, and you shouldn't want to kill yourself just to make a living trying to teach some gang member's kid who cusses you out all day and they all try and kill each other fighting all day every day and click through tests without even reading them and destroy the school when they can like ripping out bathroom sinks and pouring water on steps trying to make someone fall. Why do you hate teachers? Please make me understand why this group of people is so abhorrent to you. I bet it's because they are public employees, if their salary was paid by any other way you likely wouldn't feel this way. And then there's the media you consume that tells you how horrible the teachers unions are when they just say that because teachers' unions donate to Democratic candidates, if they donated to Republicans you'd be cheering the teachers I bet. I bet you're a big fan of the police union even though they cost you in taxes so very much more. 100s of millions in misconduct, 100s of millions in overtime, but they are GOP friendly, so they're your buddy.

exkkppq,"Three reasons why I left. 

1. No Chicago companies in my niche would offer a solid pay raise on me or take literally any risk. I work in financial technology and had 5 years experience, and many just tried to shove me in their fresh out of college intro sales positions instead of considering or accommodating a moderate experience role. I kept turning them down and telling them politely I could offer much more and privately the companies seemed too conservative to take any a risk and get to the next level. I also thought they were trying to take advantage of me being a bit desperate for any better pay. Found one in Austin that took a chance and has been super happy with my hire. Explored Denver, NYC, and Austin, and all the jobs outside the city were better opportunities because I was getting more respect. 

2. Violence and political frustration was kinda wearing on me. I had bad luck, got mugged, saw a gang shooting at close range, and got assigned to a vicious murder trial on jury duty where someone shot his girlfriend 15 times. In a year and a half it just wore me down really bad and made me feel depressed and less safe because there seemed little I could do to change that. I couldn't walk around at night without looking over my shoulder.

As for copycat suicides - there's never a control group.  We never know if a small cluster of suicides is influenced by media, all we know is in *some* cases there are 1) media reports of a suicide, and 2) a small number of additional suicides.  Correlation is not causation.  For obvious reasons we never have the control group of a single suicide unreported followed by another single suicide not reported, and on it goes, which could equal in number a reported ""copycat suicide"" outbreak... It's all murky and subject to interpretation by various non neutral sides (psychiatry wants people into treatment; suicide prevention wants more funding; anti-media bashers want any reason to bash media; the victims families tie the media in with what happened to their loved one, etc etc etc)

It's normal to blame the messenger, and that's what the media is.

[source](https://www.texasfreeway.com/austin/austin-historic-photos/)

This photo comes from Texasfreeway.com and was labeled there to have been taken on May 29, 1962, but I'm pretty sure the dedication of I-35 in Austin actually happened in March of that year. How do I know? [I have a time machine](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/113307618/i-35-dedication-on-march-29-march-16/).

Let's talk for a second about time travel. You have probably seen or read at least one story about time travel in your life. Often these stories have a [""bad future"" alternate timeline](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture) that needs to be ""corrected"" by the protagonist. Take the movie Back to the Future 2, for instance, in which Old Biff from 2015 caused an alternate timeline with a ""bad"" version of 1985 to happen by giving his 1950's self an almanac of sports scores. 

Just about every Austinite alive today who is old enough to talk knows how I-35 is too small for this city and suffers horrible traffic congestion because of it.  Well I'm convinced I-35 as we know it in Austin today is the result of time travelers messing with the timeline. The whole thing from the conception of the route to the installation of the double deck is full of paradoxes which don't make any sense. Or else maybe it's just cursed! The issue of what to do about that is controversial and a major part of the Mayoral election and runoff we just had/will have.  Today I want to share with y'all some of the crazy things I found when I went looking into the origins of I-35.

There was a [KUT article submitted here a few years ago now](https://old.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/7riaet/atxplained_why_was_i35_designed_as_a_doubledecker/) which gives us a starting point and explains some of what I'm talking about:

&gt;Interstate Highway 35 is many things to many people. It is a vital thoroughfare for commerce and shipping. It is also an economic and social barrier through much of Austin. And nearly from its construction, it has been a source of frustration for drivers stuck in its traffic. I-35 has inspired a number of questions and even legends about its design and those who made it.

&gt;First of all, most of the legends – if not all – aren’t true. One that has been floating around for decades is that the person who designed I-35 committed suicide because of the havoc unleashed upon the city with its opening. To be clear, no one who had any role in designing or constructing the upper decks of I-35 committed suicide – at least to anyone’s knowledge.

&gt;Secondly, I-35 in the Austin area is not the deadliest stretch of highway in the United States – or even in Texas. In research published last year by the Ross Law Group, Austin’s stretch of 35, all 14 miles, came in at 45th worst in Texas. The research found two other area highways, U.S. 183 and S.H. 71, statistically more deadly than I-35. None in Austin are in the top 10 deadliest.

&gt;The interstate is, however, one of the most congested. One of the solutions to ease that traffic congestion more than 50 years ago inspired a question from listener Javier Palomares:

&gt;&gt;“Why was I-35 designed as a double decker through Central Austin, instead of a wider highway?” the software engineer asked. “As far as I know, there are not many cities that have a highway running through it that was designed in the 1960s and it’s actually a double-decker.”

&gt;He’s right. There are not many highways with four lanes over two decks. Conventional highway construction would likely require officials to forcibly buy more nearby property and widen the roadway.

&gt;I-35 was initially part of the interregional highway system, built under the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944. America was trying to catch up to what World War II soldiers had seen in Germany: an interconnected freeway that could quickly transport troops and supplies … and cars. **By 1952, the first leg of “the Interregional” had sprouted in Austin – [the stretch between Airport Boulevard and what was then 19th Street (what’s now Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard)](https://www.texasfreeway.com/Austin/historic/photos/i35/images/i35_austin_undated.jpg).**

&gt;By the late ’50s, on what was then called the Interstate Highway system, you could drive from the southern city limits at Slaughter Creek to the northern city limits without leaving the Interregional. Remember, this was when highways were the future!

&gt;What was quite revolutionary for the time was that you could go all the way through town without leaving the highway, but not without stopping.

&gt;“Austin at the time had a railroad across 35,” said Ben Alley Jr. **“[We were the only city I believe in the country that had railroad stops on a freeway](https://www.texasfreeway.com/Austin/historic/photos/i35/images/i35_austin_4_23_71.jpg).”**

&gt;Alley’s dad, Ben “Benny” Alley Sr., was the assistant district engineer at the State Highway Department. As it happens, the Highway Department realized that it was quickly running out of capacity on 35. Alley Sr., who passed away in 2011, was among those who took the lead on the project to get the Interregional over the railroad and get more cars through Central Austin.

&gt;“They couldn’t build 35 wider because of the easements,” Alley Jr. said. “That would cost a fortune. They would have had to purchase all the properties on either side of 35. Building a three-lane highway on one pillar was an engineering feat.”

&gt;**When the path for 35 was initially laid, planners assumed four lanes and 200 feet would be all that would ever be needed. That left Alley and the highway department one choice at the time: [to go up.](https://www.texasfreeway.com/Austin/historic/photos/i35/images/i35_const_upperdeck_aug_1973.jpg)**

&gt;**When the upper decks opened in 1975, they were the only lanes of that type in the country.** In highway terms, this was a huge splash, one that other futuristic metropolises – like San Antonio and New Orleans – tried to emulate.

&gt;But one man’s engineering treasure, is another’s trash.

&gt;“It cuts a horrible swath through the city of Austin,” said state Sen. Kirk Watson (D-Austin). “It is – at best – an ugly scar that runs right through the city.”

&gt;For years, Watson has been trying to figure out how to reduce I-35’s visual and social impact, while helping it move traffic.

&gt;“That roadway has probably been cussed by more people than virtually any other segment of roadway in America,” he said. “And so something had to be done.”

&gt;What is not in I-35’s future through that stretch is more lanes.

&gt;“If tomorrow you had the money, if the state of Texas said, ‘We’ve got the billions of dollars necessary to just go out and build you four new lanes of capacity,’ those would be congested very soon,” Watson said. “All the studies and all the experience across the country tells you they would be congested almost immediately.”

&gt;And for now, the future of the Interregional is not up, but down.

&gt;**“We don’t have right of way,” he said. “You can’t take out cemeteries. You can’t take out downtown. You can’t take out the University of Texas. So what do you do? Well, we don’t want to go up, because that adds to the scar. Instead what this would do is it would put much of that below grade.”**

&gt;There’s a long-range plan to lower parts of 35 through downtown and beyond. That would mean removing the upper decks completely and putting toll lanes under the existing frontage road.

&gt;Would Ben Alley Jr. be upset if one of his dad’s signature projects were removed? **“He knew early on that this wasn’t going to be the big fix for I-35 traffic,” he said. “Even after it was built, it was pretty obsolete.”**

&gt;Benny Alley Sr., will have other legacies to lean on. He helped design MoPac, Loop 360 and the Pennybacker Bridge.

&gt;...

The first instance of city leaders mulling over a big highway for cars I can find was [all the way back in 1929](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/113308272/interregion-road-board-formed-august/). The [State Highway system designed in the 1910s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_State_Highway_2) was slowly being connected and paved by that time. 10 years later [President Roosevelt said a national road network was a top priority for the country.](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/113308581/roosevelt-urges-system-of-roads-for/) 

[The headline on page 1 in the January 30, 1944 edition of the Statesman](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/113308401/austin-must-begin-now-on-super-highway/) trumpeted out Austin's problem to the world:

&gt;Austin Must Begin Now On Super Highway

[Part 2 of the same article](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/113308377/austin-must-act-now-upon-superhighway/) has a map of proposed routes. It looks like Austin was always going to have a highway run through it. But where in the city should it be placed?

The very next day, [January 31, 1944, The Statesman announced that Travis County Commissioners were ready to start buying up property for highway right-of-way.](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/113308497/commissioners-are-ready-to-buy-road/). 

&gt;**""The Travis County Commissioners' Court will buy whatever width right-of-way is needed, wherever and whenever, the state highway department wants it,""** Judge Matthews declared. ""In fact, we've been urging the highway department to let us buy it for some time.""

A little over a month later [The Statesman reported on City leaders realizing the ""Southern Pacific Llano Line"" railroad was going to cross the new interstate highway](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/113309028/changing-rail-routespg1-march-5/) and how they should probably move that. As we know today, this was not done as it should have been, which is one of the reasons why upper decks were necessary within a decade after completion.

To those unfamiliar, it may sound counter-intuitive but I assure you it's really the case. I won't get into the details here but if someone asks for more information about it, I will be happy to oblige.

I had a major depressive episode two years ago and am still trying my best to recover. Unfortunately, I lost my full-time, and well-paid job, along with a long-term spouse and the few friends I had in that time. While the worst is behind me, I am finding it incredibly difficult to get over the hurdle of loneliness. 

I have tried to get out and meet people but it never progresses to an actual friendship - just a IG follow or someone to text once a month. I don't know how to actually become part of a social group. I work freelance and very few hours at a nightshift job usually by myself. So, work rarely ever translates into spending time with the same people consistently. 

The depression forced me to move back home and, coming this January, I am finally moving back out, so in a sense it's a new beginning. This also means that I won't get to see the people I got to know in the last year, triggering some anxiety. I would greatly appreciate any advice or support from this community.

&gt; Signal Hill, which flows with oil to this day, had so many derricks that a Depression-era WPA guide to Los Angeles said it resembled “an aroused porcupine.” And recently, a USGS study suggested that the killer 1933 Long Beach quake may have been caused by deep drilling down the coast in Huntington Beach.

&gt; Naturally, this tempting bonanza made for schemes and scams. The most brazen was the Julian oil scandal, a stock-manipulation Ponzi scheme that fleeced tens of thousands of Angelenos out of more than $100 million. One accused crook was shot dead in court by a man who had lost his life savings. Los Angeles’ district attorney went to San Quentin for taking bribes. And C.C. Julian himself sold up and left town, tried to pull another fast one in Oklahoma, skipped bail and ran off to Shanghai, where he poisoned himself.

&gt; To this day, there they remain, planted in parking lots and business districts and neighborhoods, disguised as stylish towers or nondescript office buildings, or with all their dipping-duck unsightliness right out there, still milking maybe 100 million barrels a year out of the ground, generating what it’s always been about — money and jobs.

&gt; And orphan wells, the ghosts of the boomtown, still pock underfoot Los Angeles, some open, some capped, some played out. The furls of pollution from abandoned wells alone put toxics into neighborhoods now crowded with houses, parks, schools. They confound public health regulations. Cities and environmental justice groups trying to put an end to oil operations run right into, well, a tarpit of grandfathered permits, aggressive oil companies, and arcane petro-chemical regulations. California was still issuing fracking permits last year. The city of L.A. has hoped to create buffer zones around oil operations; if you can’t take the pollution away from the people, at least try to keep the people away from the pollution.

&gt; If all this has got you thinking about sticking an auger into your yard and hoping for a gusher, it might not even be yours. Deeds and mineral rights are such a patchwork that sometimes you own only what’s as far down as the iceplant roots, and sometimes the mineral rights even stayed with some previous owner.

Like last week's photo, this sketch comes from the [Austin History Center's ""Audiovisual Archive""](https://ahc.access.preservica.com/archive) which includes hundreds of scanned historic photos, drawings, postcards, etc. [like these from the mid-19th century](https://ahc.access.preservica.com/?s=austin&hh_cmis_filter=ahc_dc.daterange/1800s|ahc_dc.daterange/1860s|ahc_dc.daterange/1850s|ahc_dc.daterange/1830s|ahc_dc.daterange/1840s|ahc_dc.daterange/unknown|ahc_dc.daterange/1820s&hh_cmis_sort=$c2%20asc). 

Austin in 2024 has become a place for streamers banned from Twitch to host a historically unprecedented Hunger Games-like scavenger hunt involving purple RFID tags scanned by a group of 50 attention-starved edgelords, and I think the city will never be the same. But on the bright side, at least probably no one will move here because of this. It makes me think about how we got to this place. And so because of this, today I'm retreating to the distant past to share with y'all one of the earliest Austin stories, from the before time (the longlongago), when things were more affordable. 

**In 1856 everything you see in the sketch was The City of Austin.** There was no ""east side"" or ""west austin"" at that point, no suburbs to speak of. There were other ranching and farming settlements in the area to be sure, such as Govalle, Hornsby Bend, and Montopolis, and at Barton Springs, but these were separate places, not considered part of the city. [Governor Pease's ""Woodlawn""](https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2023/01/08/identity-of-historic-pease-mansion-owner-remains-mystery/), which is today on Niles Road in Old West Austin, was considered the frontier.  

While it might look idyllic, the City of Austin you see in the sketch was not a hospitable place for many people, and that doesn't even include talking about the blatant racism/slavery of the time. Cholera epidemics, smallpox, and cases of 'fever' were a chronic problem. There were still Native American attacks at this point but more often than not they just stole a lot of horses.  The outskirts were one hair shy of total lawlessness and highwaymen were known to rob travelers. Add on top of that, the humidity we all know and love today really brought out the smell of the horse shit in the streets back then, which washed into the river when it rained. This was [Rip Ford's Austin](https://texasranger.pastperfectonline.com/byperson?keyword=Ford%2C%20John%20Salmon%20%22RIP%22), a racist, murdering, grizzled old Texas Ranger and the duly elected Mayor and City Marshall, who once enforced a city-wide ban on people with brown skin.

**But how did that get there? Who picked that spot?** Well you have to go back about 18 years before this photo. Many longtime Austinites know this tale, and I've shared with y'all a few second hand accounts of this origin story before. I'm not sure I've ever shared part of this particular version of it but it either case it bears repeating. It comes from the book [Seat of Empire by Jeffrey Stuart Kerr: The Embattled Birth of Austin, Texas](https://www.texascapitolgiftshop.com/100153/seat-of-empire-the-embattled-birth-of-austin-texas.html), which is one of the best and well-researched books on the subject. We're going back to the Village of Waterloo in the year **1838, when the whole area you see in the sketch was once black with thousands upon thousands of buffalo**.  

Quoting now from Chapter 1 in the book, entitled Mirabeau Lamar's Buffallo

>In the fall of 1838, the tiny hamlet of Waterloo, Texas welcomed the most important visitor in its brief history. At the time, the town had not yet even been incorporated, Congress not taking that step until the following January. Lying farther up the Colorado River than any other Anglo settlement, Waterloo presented a humble appear-ance to the dignitary and his entourage. 

>Only a few log cabins scattered around the mouth of Shoal Creek greeted Willis Avery, James C. Rice, and four other Texas Rangers along as guardians against Indian attack. The Reverend Edward Fontaine, friend of the important man, accompanied the group, and may have had his slave Jacob with him. 

>Commanding the greatest attention, however, was the Georgia native, San Jacinto hero, and highest ranking member of the entourage, Mirabeau B. Lamar, Vice President of the Republic of Texas. Lamar coveted the presidency. He seemed fated to get it. His most formidable political opponent, President Sam Houston, was constitution-ally barred from succeeding himself. Incredibly, two other leading challengers, Peter Grayson and James Collinsworth, had committed suicide within two days of each other. 

>On July 9, while traveling through Tennessee, the unstable Grayson wrote a note begging his landlord to ""pardon the frightful scene I have made in your house"" and ""blew his braines out with a pistol."" After Supreme Court Chief Justice James Collinsworth publicly announced his candidacy on June 30, he went on a drinking spree that culminated July 11 in his jumping or falling off a boat into Galveston Bay. Most people believed his drowning death was a suicide.' Lamar thus seemed a guaranteed victor in the coming election. His friends, however, urged him to take nothing for granted. 

>In June Senator Albert C. Horton, a vice-presidential candidate, advised a trip west to court the frontier vote. Judge James Webb also saw political advantage in a western journey: 

>>It is the opinion of several of your friends with whom I have conversed, that a trip up the Country would be serviceable to you. I think so too—there is no telling what impression may be made on the minds of the people on the eve of the Election—you know by whom the effort will be made, if made at all, & you therefore know in what section of the Country to expect it—in Houston & all the lower part of the Country, there is no danger.' 

>Lamar evidently saw wisdom in his friends' advice, for he made the risky journey. Once at Bastrop he was well into dangerous frontier terri-tory. After leaving the town and crossing the Colorado River, the vice president and his companions meandered through a lush landscape of tall grass and scattered woods before fording the river again and stopping at Josiah Wilbarger's place on Wilbarger Creek.

>The party then traversed Webber's Prairie, passed Hornsby's Bend, and paused to rest at Fort Cole-man on Walnut Creek. The stockade most likely offered little protection. After its abandonment the preceding April, local residents had quickly begun dismantling its walls and blockhouses to make use of the lumber in other construction projects.' Once beyond the remains of the fort, the party waded through several more miles of grassland before reaching Waterloo. 

>Although Edward Burleson had laid out the town of Waterloo early in 1838, Tennessee native Jacob Harrell was the first Anglo to occupy the site. Harrell and his wife Mary brought their four children to Texas in 1833, settling among Reuben Hornsby's clan at Hornsby's Bend. Two years later Harrell erected a tent several miles upriver on the Colorado's north shore near the mouth of Shoal Creek. Because this spot in the river formed a natural low-water crossing, he likely knew that it lay along an ancient Indian trail long used by travelers heading north and west through the hills.' 

>By 1838 Jacob Harrell had constructed a split-log stockade to re-place the tent and moved his family to their new home. Several families followed suit.' No Anglo community lay upriver from Harrell and his immediate neighbors; the tiny settlement defined the frontier's extreme edge. As any good political campaigner must, Mirabeau Lamar quickly joined in local custom upon his arrival in Waterloo. For Jacob Harrell and other frontiersmen, this meant hunting. **One morning as Lamar, Harrell, and the others breakfasted in Harrell's cabin, one of Harrell's sons burst into the room with the exciting news that the prairie was ""full of buffalo.""** 

>Quickly astride their mounts, the men rode the short distance to a ravine which intersected the Colorado River. To their delight they encountered great numbers of the mammoth beasts and wasted no time in shooting as many as they could. 

>With the right weapon a buffalo is easy to kill. Because of its poor vision, it relies primarily on its sense of smell to detect danger. Thus, if a hunter stays upwind and possesses a rifle powerful enough to send a ball through the animal's thick hide, it is possible to pick off large numbers one by one without the surrounding members of the herd sensing danger. When he hunted for food or hides, the Anglo settler preferred this method 
 
>For sport the hunter chose a more thrilling technique. Armed with one or more single-shot pistols, he charged on horseback through the herd while blazing away at the fleeing beasts. At the bottom of the ravine bisecting the prairie near Waterloo, Mirabeau Lamar chased and shot ""with his holster pistol"" the largest buffalo bull one of his companions had ever seen. Later, one of the hunters blew a bugle to gather the men atop a hill at the head of the ravine.",comment,Austin,0.0

18fjtl,"This will probably never make it anywhere, but I need to vent on this Dorner situation. If just one person reads this, it was worth my time. I'm gonna play devils advocate here. 

The system failed him and us (the people). There probably is a lot of truth behind what he said that went on in the LAPD (in his manifesto). Just look at how they handled pulling over a vehicle they ""thought"" was him, only to find out it was two Asian women. It's shoot before investigate with these guys and it's awful. 

Why did the system fail him? Corruption and poor ethics within police agencies. But we may never know the true story, unfortunately. Did Dorner do what was right? In his mind, yes. He snapped, he had enough, was at his breaking point and collapsed. 

The future is health care reform: treating depression as a medical condition, physiological counseling, more access to therapy with licensed professionals. This stuff has been medically proven to work, and the U.S. refuses to change. Had we looked at Dorner long before this happened and treated him with the proper health care, none of us would have ever heard this mans name. He would just remain another face in the crowd, which is a good thing. **Edit**: What I'm playing at is that seeing a therapist shouldn't be looked at as taboo. Do we look at treating a broken bone as taboo? No, so why would we think it's ""wrong"" or ""weird"" to see a therapist to help fix our emotions. The answer is, we shouldn't. **End Edit**

Things of this nature will continue until the United States changes the way it looks at mental health care of its populace. 

I do not, in any form, condone the behavior of Dorner or anyone else who acts out like this. I do sympathize with him for feeling like society screwed him over, but I completely disagree with how he went about handling the situation. It's a dog-eat-dog world out there people.

Please bear with me, this might be long but I am so overwhelmed right now, I just need help from a decent human being who understands these things because I was humiliated today.

I am an immigrant with a social security number and I applied for health insurance. I've been here for over a year and I apparently quality for Healthfirst's Essential Plan 4 because me and my husband and broke. We've been trying to get jobs because we recently got our work authorization documents, but it's been very difficult.

We haven't been to a doctor in two years. We haven't been feeling well mentally or physically. Healthfirst automatically assigned us healthcare providers. I called the number on the documents that were sent to us (under our PCP's name) and it directs us to someone who asks for our member ID numbers, our address and our county. 

She told me that my PCP is not available until 2025 and my husband's PCP is not available until April. She then asked me what my concerns are and I told her I need to do a general consult because I've been feeling extremely exhausted, I have headaches 90% of the time and I'd also like a referral to see a therapist (because my plan covers it). My husband has also had a cough for about three weeks that we'd like to get checked out.

I asked her if we could try to walk in and see any PCP that might be available, and she said she wouldn't advise it because they probably wouldn't see us. She THEN transferred me to another number, to whom I explained everything again and for some reason he got fixated on the fact that I said I need a referral to see a therapist and told me to go to the emergency psych ward to the nearest hospital.  Mind you, this is not a mental health emergency, I just need to see a therapist because my plan covers it. I have been feeling depressed and anxious and I just need to talk to someone. He told me that I self diagnosed. 

He also didn't believe me when I told him that the previous woman had said that my PCP has no availability until 2025. He then went on to tell me that I am undocumented and I don't actually have health insurance, I just have a waiver (whatever that means). He was extremely condescending, I kept trying to ask him how do I see a PCP, he wouldn't even let me finish my questions, repeatedly interrupted me and talked to me like a child. 

I am documented, I am a nonresident alien with an SSN and a work authorization. My NY State of Health account says that I am enrolled in Healthfirst's Essential Plan 4 insurance plan and I can see all the plan benefits, but this guy was telling me that I don't actually have insurance.

I just started crying on the phone because he wouldn't explain anything to me and he said he would call back in a couple of hours. I don't even want to answer to be humiliated like that again. I just want to know how to see a doctor, that's it.

New construction helps alleviate upward price pressure for existing market rate, but the subsidized market is not heavily impacted as it's well below even depressed market rate rents. 

Further, subsidized housing has to meet certain criteria, meaning not all market rate units can be converted to affordable housing (which would be necessary for your ""trickle down housing"" theory to prove true). 

It's really a sub segment of the overall housing economy that requires different efforts to satisfy market demands.

When we do that, then I will be all for removing people from the streets to someplace they can go.

Include a bed, a chair, a table, and utensil.

  
Get them on a food programs.

  
Do NOT include entertainment devices. Use those as goals you can help them achieve by getting a job.

Small goal, then larger goals.

  
Teach them how to plan.

When they get a job, start charging them a small 'rent'. That money actual goes into an escrow, and when they move into there own place, the monies are returned to them. DO NOT let them use the monies for the cost of getting a place. They need to save that money separately.  This makes paying bills normal for them, and will act as a small buffer.

I didn't tell them anything was wrong because I was too embarrassed and I knew it would hurt them. I wasn't equipped to deal with the things going on in my life, and that's not surprising. Young teenagers are like halfway developed as human beings. Parents don't always know anything is wrong, and if they do know, they often have no idea how strongly it is actually affecting the kid. They might know someone is picking on their kid and think they solved the problem by calling the school and having a teacher address it, and their child could think it's a much bigger deal and kill them self the next day. 

This is a messy situation and there is no justification for any kind of blanket statement declaring that things weren't handled correctly and a certain person is to blame.

The NYT used to do exactly one ""China story"" every day, and it would always be something along the lines of a depressing human interest story, like ""little girl who scores 100% on tests denied seat at middle school because her mother argued with a police officer."" So for a country with 1 billion people, rather than making an effort to hit the top 5 or top 10 stories of international interest, they would run a single human interest story like a demoralization operation. Then they started criticizing Tiger Woods for playing at Augusta, and arguing that someone who is part-Black shouldn't play at a  single-sex Club, for months and months. \[I don't play golf or care about golf, but this seemed to be a huge pet issue for the NYT.\] Over the years they gradually switched from being mostly ""news"" (with some human interest, and some local coverage), to aggressive agenda-setting.  Almost all of their coverage on the GWOT post-911 through the W Bush and Obama Administrations was garbage, in my opinion, if not directly authored by the CIA, it might as well have been. ""Anonymous sources tell us the #2 Al Qaida has been killed in a dramatic raid..."" For me, at least, the NYT stopped being a useful source of news, analysis, and opinion.

cv19t96,"The answer to that question leads you down some pretty depressing/interesting/legally grey/huge bubble that will pop, roads. For context, start here: http://www.fieldofschemes.com/ Basically new stadiums are built for the express purpose of enriching ownership, with little to show for the public benefit. Ownership groups want new stadiums for the new ticket rights, selling high priced boxes, new concession deals, etc. And they demand as much public financing as they can from the host city. 

The threat being that if the team does not receive said financing, they will leave. It is a terrific extortion racket. To your question, the product on the field, and the stadium experience are very insulated from each other. Teams can't just go out and ""spend billions of dollars on better players."" The leagues of which they are a part have checks in place to ensure that rich teams can't just outright buy the best talent. This is done through caps (hard and soft), luxury tax penalties for exceeding said cap, and revenue sharing.

The money set aside for free agents is pretty concrete at this point, it does fluctuate in baseball more than any other sport, but again, there are checks in place to ensure against outspending your opponents. As for the business side, whatever money is not given to the team through bond issuances, and/or tax incentives (public financing), is raised by taking out loans on the franchises assets, money is granted from the league for new construction, and finally, if the cost of the stadium still isn't covered yet, from ownership. Ownership wants to get away with spending as little of their money as possible. 

Op Ed:  

For the most incredible of the fuckery, see the Minnesota Viking s deal, and the Florida Marlins deal. The Braves deal is pretty sheisty, and the Falcons deal is positively on the up-and-up compared to the above listed. It's still not great. 

In closing, it's a great big scam. Public money is financing an explosion of new stadium construction, which does not benefit the public in anyway. Recently, Scott Walker, after cutting 250 million, yes a quarter of a billion, yes, 250,000,000 dollars from the University of Wisconsin's budget, handed that money over to the Milwaukee Bucks for a new basketball arena. A conservative republican who has ostensibly cut his teeth by being a budget slasher and ""responsible spender"" gave 250 million public dollars to a sports franchise. And don't think I am just holding republicans accountable either. Dekalb county is giving Author Blank a 30 million dollar PRACTICE FACILITY for Atlanta's new MLS team. With the concrete assurance that Mr. Blank will be super nice to the county, and allow them to use part of the new facility for a new office for Dekalb's Parks Department. ""Oh please Mr. Blank, take our money, and this county owned land, but pretty please let us use it too, please...""

gu2rnfa,"This is just objectively false. There were a few extremely wealthy business people with ties to Japanese manufacturing/commerce that were more in favor of aiding the Japanese, but no one in power wanted anything remotely like that.

American sentiment toward the war was initially extremely negative, Woodrow Wilson had this unrealistic and idealistic idea of world peace headed by American leadership, which obviously fell flat on its face in both 1914 and 1917.

American citizens saw how much life was lost in WWI (over 100,000 in the little over a year we were in the war) with very little to have come of it. It was very different for the people in Europe to see the benefit of American help late in the war, but 5,000+ miles was a world away in 1918 and the positive affect of joining the war was not at all felt.

Further, in the late 1930s when war was imminent in Europe, America grappled with the depths of the Great Depression. Most Americans felt their time and effort was better served fixing the problems at home rather than meddling in another conflict abroad (ironically it was American involvement in WWII that helped pull the country out of the Great Depression).

That sentiment changed pretty rapidly, though, as the Blitz tore through Europe. In early 1940 an overwhelming majority of Americans were against joining the war. By early 1941 nearly 70% of Americans favored war. 

American and German relations were strained for essentially the entire 12 year reign of the 1000 year Reich (1933-1945). Americans seriously opposed the Nazis, and diplomatic relations were tenuous. By 1938 relations had completely soured. And then finally, the Lends-Lease Act in early 1941 effectively ended American neutrality in the war well before we officially entered.

So no, there were never serious questions to which side we should enter. The only serious question was *if* we should enter, and obviously Pearl Harbor decided that for us. But even without the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, we likely would have joined the war on the side of the Allies.",comment,Boston,1.0

12qr5j9,"NEED HELP (looking for a friend) *Could be Triggering*SUICIDE Does anyone know of a site that would list death notices in the Seattle area? I find a lot of those ""pay to get the full shocking report"" type sites, but I'm just looking for simple information. Was there a death reported for my friend? 

 Here's my story:  I have a friend who has lived in the Seattle area for many years.  He has a history of depression and has been hospitalized many times before.  My connections with him are off and on.  We'll connect for a while then he'll drop off the face of the earth.  

I had not heard from him since August 2021.  He would not return any contacts except email to which I'd just ask him to reply, ""I'm alive"" so I know he's ok.  Last week, I got an email from him that was a goodbye note. He detailed how he had set the email to go out after he was gone and was unsure how long it would be before he would be found.  He gave no other information as to how he was going to end his life. I've called his phone numerous times so he is either not answering or unable to.

The last address I had for him was in Auburn (112th Ave).  I know that he wasn't living there any longer because he talked of neighbors below him being loud 24/7 and others down the hall selling drugs out of their apartments.  The address I had was a duplex, so he obviously wasn't living there any longer. On one of the pay sites it listed ""N. Pacific"" as a current address which has a lot of apartments.

Still, I called the local police for that old address and filled them in to see if they could find out where he was and to do a welfare check. They said they would check it out and get back to me. Well, if they don't even have the right address, there's nothing to do.

My only lead is that I know he has been on SSI disability for years. Surely they would have his current address. In his email, he talked about leaving letters for me at the scene with information to take whatever he had from disability and donate it to a charity.

So at this point I am stumped as to what to do. Surely if he did end his life and is in an apartment setting, the neighbors would start to get the signs that a dead body is around. Then again, I don't know what kind of info he left to contact me.  Any suggestions?",submission,Seattle,1.0

Thats not to say Africans dont experience racism in America, but African-americans experience it a whole lot more.

I dont think you are getting what im saying. The black community has many problems in America. They fact of the matter is that black people being the most economical depressed group in America, responsible for a majority of crimes and more are a direct result of living in a society where their ancestors were regularly enslaved, beaten, raped, separated from families, intimidated by those that hated them, deprived of basic rights and forced to live into poor environments. This is black history. You make it seem like black people just make excuses and have had an equal playing field from day 1. News flash, literally a majority of black history is riddled with them trying to navigate a society that hated them. Im not saying that we would continue harping on the past, but at the same time understand that it is the past of African-americans that has resulted in where they are today. Ghettos and violence associated with them are a product of a racist powers that did not have the well-being of black people as a priority. Yes. The root of it is racism. When one group hates another, and believes themselves superior to them, the stuff that has happened in America is exactly what happens. Denying this only allows this shit to continue. Really, its psychology 101.

hhjvc2x,"TLDR on bottom
Well the article was pretty lax on the science and according to someone else who commented and follows this, the article was a bit lax on fact checking, however...

Ephedra meth was a lot easier to produce, really not hard to figure out if you had organic chemistry classes at a college level or knew some guy who knew a guy who knew mixing a few things made meth. Might not be the best product, but hey, its meth, right? Plus you could just get Sudafed or prior to that being popular, old school hydroxycut and other diet pills that had ephedrine before the FDA cracked down on ephedrine being in so many things. Not sure if that was done, but it was an easy source. Its actually extremely easy to get your hands on conjugates of ephedrine that's semi legally or straight up illegal in many ""nutritional"" products, but it's hard to crack down on all derivatives of one compound, and it would take a bit more know how to turn it into something like meth. 

The article also describes P2P meth, derived from Phenyl-2-propanone. As someone else in the comments pointed out, the purity has been high in these products for ""a long time"", however the article mentioned 2009 and 12yrs is arguably ""a long time"", but it's possible the purity was decent, like 70% then jumped to something like 90%+ which still wouldn't meet a lot of modern lab standards, but eh. I'm not certain of any exactness and for interviewing a man who did chemical testing on meth for the DEA, its surprisingly they didn't quote specifics, especially with how long the damn thing was. The article lists an interview with the chemist about how P2P can be taken to make meth in a myriad of ways, and he was seeing all these new ways post 2009. Its not surprising because synthesis of anything can really be taken in any direction you want, controlling for cost, equipment (or lack thereof), availability of reagents, ease of rxn, etc etc. So that's not surprising or even special. Added in for a pizzaz in my opinion. On ochem tests, we were given an end molecule, a full sheet of paper, and given an hour to come up with the precursor, then all the reagents, methods, and intermediates to get to the end (retrosynthesis, starting backwards) or starting from the beginning (synthesis), because there are so many ways to get from A-&gt;B. Back to the purity aspect. In organic chemistry, chirality, or ""handedness"" is very important. Organic chemistry is all about how things fit in a 3D space. Your hands are mirror opposite but a left hand doesn't fit a right hand glove (think baseball glove or oven mitts, not Latex/nitrile gloves). These stereoisomers are just reflections, so their physical properties (reflection of light, solubility, boiling point, etc) are identical. In general, a rxn to create an organic compound will not favor one or the other, and will create a 50/50 mix. A notable example is thalidomide. One stereoisomer was the anti-nausea and the other caused the birth defects. Life chemistry, like amino acids, are almost always L (a big question in the field actually) with a few being D, and a notable case decades ago where a supplement contained too much of a D that was supposed to be L and killed people. I don't remember which it was, but the wrong handed version is not very friendly to being alive. We use a similar method of using messed up base pairs as drugs for some viral infections. The virus uses these bad base pairs to create their RNA then ""die"" because the RNA is unusable to create proteins needed to ""live"" and reproduce. To bring it back to meth, d-methamphetamine is the psychoactive, neurotoxic version wanted on the street. Finding a chemical rxn or process to either create more D vs L, or separate them out would cause a much higher purity of the psyoactive version. I haven't made meth before, but I assume this was a non-issue with the ephedrine based meth before ephedrine was already in the wanted configuration and you're just modulating it, so that stereoisomer duality isn't a problem. 

One thing I forgot to mention in my summary was the cost of meth. According to the article, meth is insanely cheaper than decades ago, thus people are just consuming more. I don't know if this is true, but if it is, the purity wouldn't matter as much because one is taking more and just speeding up the affects from a chronic exposure to a much more acute timeline. It is possible that newer production methods are leaving contaminants that weren't a brain issue before. Might've hurt the liver or whatnot quite a bit, but these contaminants might be broken down to be small enough, and become imposter chemicals that can cross the blood brain barrier, wreaking even more havoc than just good old neurotoxic d-methamphetamine. For example, Pb (lead) should be a 4+ charge according to the periodic table. Because of how dense it is, it often takes on a 2+ charge instead of 4+, but due to periodic trends, its tighter than would be anticipated, and something like Ca (calcium) is looser. Ca is also 2+ charge. The lead is an imposter metal and gets uptaken in the body and used wherever calcium is, which is every cell in the body and stored in the bones as excess. Hg (mercury) does something similar when attached to small organic functional groups, like methyl and ethyl groups, which allow it to be absorbed instead of pooped out and then goes into circulation and destroying the CNS (central nervous system). 

The article, near the end, also mentions the increase of individuals taking both opioids/opiates. Possibly, the combo is synergistic. That doesn't make too much sense because the pathways are different, but brain chemistry is a wacky game. We're only now moving away from the serotonin hypothesis of depression as we find out most is made in the gut, and a newer theory is these drugs take so long because that's about how long it takes for a budding neurons to grow and flourish, and antidepressants might actually be stimulating more brain cell growth, rather than fixing a chemical imbalance. But than antidepressants are a crap shoot and we're originally only for severe and moderate-severe depression anyway but marketed for lesser cases to boost pharma sales so take your pick. 


TLDR:
So, if we're making assumptions with the info provided in the article, ""new meth"" is cheaper and ostensibly is leading to higher consumption (no evidence given however). The cheapness might just mean its being supplemented with opioids/opiates, leading to a synergistic affect in the brain, although the pathways are different. If we assume that consumption levels have not changed and there is no synergistic affect, then it's solely the composition of the new meth causing these problems. This composition change might be a higher psyoactive, neurotoxic isomer purity due to better manufacturing, higher contaminant level, or different contaminates than before that are accelerating neurodegeneration. Possibly none of this either, if it's true that P2P derived meth wasn't popular before, and more people are using it and its inherently worse, weren't just seeing more people with worse problems than ephedra meth because more people are using this type. There's so much hypothesizing here because the article is lacking in many areas of evidence to back up claims, and some commenters on my summary have made good points about how the article almost seems completely fabricated.",comment,LosAngeles,1.0

laj6ggm,"West Hollywood doesn’t have a downtown. Not sure where you were, but there are occasional prostitutes on Santa Monica Blvd. But I wouldn’t go so far as to say it is “unsafe” lol. Did the prostitutes offend you? That is an area with a lot of promiscuous homosexuality. And the sunset strip part of WeHo I suppose has promiscuous heterosexuality. If you don’t want to see people of whatever gender in tiny skirts, high heels, and fishnet stockings, then yes, I suppose WeHo is not for you.

And WeHo is definitely not for everyone. A lot of my gay friends avoid it as well. And I avoid the sunset strip for similar reasons. WeHo is kind of a no rules all night party town for people with too much money, that want to flaunt their money and/or half naked bodies. But it can be fun if you are in that party mode, and there are some more chill bars and nice restaurants too if you know where to look.

All that being said, if that type of thing disturbs you, then you should get out to more peaceful and law-abiding regions of LA. You would probably like Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach. Super clean, no homeless, very wealthy, kind of a white people who just got off a yacht vibe. But has a lot of fun nightlife and great restaurants. The Manhattan beach pier is more for aunts and uncles. The Hermosa beach pier is for the spoiled children that want to see live cover bands.

Pasadena might interest you as well. Old town has a lot of shopping, from small clothing stores to boutique crafts to department stores. It’s a lively and busy suburban atmosphere, with a lot of families, but it has character as well and is very pretty. It’s not just a generic shopping mall with chain stores. Not necessarily wealthy, but upper middle class, and well policed. Safe to say you will never see a transsexual prostitute in fishnet stockings in old town Pasadena.

Also maybe consider Los Feliz, but they do have some homeless people there. Again, it’s not unsafe. Most of LA is safe. But if you don’t like prostitutes, you probably also won’t like poop covered homeless people smoking meth and screaming at walls. Los Feliz and Silver Lake are both very nice, great boutique shops and amazing nightlife and restaurants. But yes just keep in mind that there are homeless that wander around in those areas asking for change or just drugged out of their minds.

Santa Monica is similar. Super safe, very nice places to shop and get drinks, or go on the pier and ride the roller coaster. But Santa Monica especially has a lot of homelessness which is more then anything, just kind of depressing to see. They rarely cause any violence. Venice Beach you would not like at all I’m guessing. Homelessness, people smoking weed everywhere, skateboarding punks, and random morons doing criminal activities occasionally. Still, I took my mom to Venice beach when she was in town and we rode bikes to Santa Monica. It’s not unsafe.

things have been alright for me because my parents and i get along pretty well. every once in a while i feel like crap and want to be somewhere else besides my apartment, but that's just something i have to deal with. things aren't that bad for me and in general, i'm sure i'm better off than a lot of other people, so i really can't complain.

it's the stress and the situation that we're in that's driving normal people to act out. i'm sure most of us have never been in a situation like this and it's incredibly scary to be dealing with a contagious disease that doctors/scientists aren't fully familiar with. on top of that, the news and the general reality of this situation is enough to freak people out. some people can handle stress better than others and those that can't end up acting out in one way or another.",comment,NYC,1.0

2xforf,"HELP!!! I (25 m) need a job really soon to move out of house/pay off student debts. Hello Houston redditors,

Almost a month ago, I failed an exam to continue in a graduate program I was attending in Virginia and had to move back to Houston. It really sucked because I was one class away from receiving a masters, and I have taken out 90,000 dollars in debt to attend the school. Now, I have all that debt and nothing to show for it. 

On top of this, my relationship with my parents is not very good right now. I recently confronted my mother about her emotionally abusive comments that she has made at me since childhood (e.g. she's told me to fk off multiple times, called me a fagt because people were calling me gay in hs, would tell me how fat I was getting multiple times, berated me for mistakes I made) and how I didn't like her brother (my uncle) taking advantage of our family by leaving his children with us all the time and because he used my credit card without my permission. Thus, we haven't spoken for a few months and it has been a tense situation since I've been back.

I'm not a slacker nor unintelligent person either. I have an undergraduate degree from Rice University in mathematical economics and did quite a few extracurricular activities while I was there. I had a job working at the front desk of the study center and have a lot of experience tutoring. 

I haven't had much success finding a job here. I've tried teaching positions, but my lack of teaching experience hurts me there and I've only been interviewed once. This is not to mention the fact that the job will not start until August. I fell I could try something like a business analyst or  consulting since I know that software and line of thinking, but those jobs have pasted their hiring seasons and I don't have an internship or office experience. Thus, my money has come from what I have left of my student loans from graduate school and some money I make here and there from tutoring students.  

My whole situation has made me a bit depressed, but I'm hopeful I'll find something soon so that I can move on with my life and get out of my parents house. If anyone has advice, leads on jobs, or just words of inspiration, that would be helpful to me right now, it would be appreciated. 

EDIT: Thanks guys! I was a little worried I'd get more negative comments but y'all been a big help. I figured Houston is big, but a closeknit city so I wanted to come to y'all.

I just turned 25. I live in Buffalo NY, and make a decent living for myself (Roughly $49k a year after bonuses and stuff) working in commercial banking (back office). For where I live, this is pretty good. I make enough money that I don't really need to worry about money and am paying off my student loans (300 a month) without much problem. I currently have around $18,000 in savings, though I plan on putting a greater emphasis on saving money in 2016. Given my yearly bonus, taxes, etc. I'll probably be able to have around $25,000 by mid year.

My life is fine, but I'm floundering. My job is stable, but boring. Most of my co-workers have either found better jobs or moved to different departments. This could be my naivety, but I feel that after 3 years I've outgrown my role, and I do not think that my company has any plans on changing things up for me in the near future. I've been depressed all year, mostly due to the blazee sameness. 

A lot of my friends from college live in and around NYC, with varying degrees of happiness about that. I visit three or four times a year, with another trip probably coming up in January. I've thrown around trying to move there since I graduated a few years ago, but I never really had the means. I fall in love with the city more each time I visit.

My thoughts are:

Would I be able to have any recruiter take me seriously if I don't have an address in the city? Or will even I have any luck finding a job on my own without moving closer? 

There's a small chance that I would be able to convince my employer to let me move to NYC and work remotely full time (Other employees have, so why not?). Granted, I would not experience the same quality of life in Buffalo as NYC at that salary, but I imagine I wouldn't feel complete impoverished?  I could also ask for an internal transfer, but I don't really see anything opening up for me in NYC for them.

After visiting around, I really liked my stay around Astoria. From what I can tell, the prices seemed fairly manageable there. 

Any other misc. thought you have for me would be greatly appreciated.

hx4ye8g,"Because the rich and their cronies have successfully pitted the middle class against the working class, and convinced us that all of our problems are a result of each other. I'm firmly upper-middle-class -- I can take vacations, I bought a house last year, I'll probably get to retire some day -- and I'm disgusted by the number of people in my socioeconomic class who seem to think the biggest threat to their way of life is the filthy poors threatening to do things like not starve and have roofs over their heads. And while most of my poor friends -- and I do mean poor, I'm talking about people risking eviction as they fall behind on rent -- recognize that the middle class aren't the enemy, I see an entirely different story on reddit, where the poor seem to think that people like myself and the woman in this article are the real problem.

To the extent that the middle class are the problem, it's a result of propaganda and structural advantages put in place by the truly wealthy, not a result of our own manipulation of the economy. And to the extent that the poor are the problem, it's a result of being perpetually disadvantaged, which creates long-term problems that are going to hurt to solve -- for instance, housing becomes a much worse investment if we fix our zoning issues, which is probably a good thing long-term, but fucks over a lot of people who were told that buying a house was a way to secure their financial future.

Man, now I'm depressed.

1clpe97,"Seattle broke me  This isn’t something meant to provoke. It is simply an outsider’s experience, because all the time I was here that’s what I felt like, an outsider. I entered Seattle 3 years ago during the pandemic with a strong heartfelt desire to be part and to help grow a “once I thought” awesome outdoor market with a vision of connection in the outdoors. I entered REI for this, and the vision I had of REI and this industry slowly but surely shattered into the reality of brute capitalism and disregard for community. I realized that everything was so embellished and marketed fancy as a fantasy of bullshit and people chose to stay in their small group comfort zone instead of take interest in others. I come from a Latin American culture of care for others and reciprocity, something I found very little of in this so called progressive city. When this city calls itself progressive without showing a genuine interest in the stories and lives of others it shows a self proclaimed yet false notion of awareness and inclusiveness. I never felt loved or included in this city except by 3 friends that had busy lives. This city isn’t for single guys, we feel discarded, disposed off, cast aside and forgotten by society.

Obsession with work, workaholism, lack of connection and desire to build community is what I experienced here. People work themselves to depression and even death in this city, that’s why it suicide rate is so high. This city isn’t meant for a place to start your career no matter how bad you want it. Honestly 3 years of pain and rejections can break anyone. The place I though I could call home politely yet surely told me it didn’t want me there. Seattle to you, I only moved here for the mountains but even the mountains aren’t worth your bullshit and apathetic state of depression. If you’ve ever lived in Latin America or been there enough time to internalize the culture you would understand where I’m coming from. 

I am thankful for all the growth and independence I gained through individualism, but this place goes beyond that, it has an hyperindividualistic complex and I am sick of it. Thankfully I am moving to Mexico City, a place that in day it gave me what Seattle in 3 years couldn’t, that care and warmth that we Latinos long for. Seattle taught me not to give a fuck about anyone or anything, a state of being that I don’t want to be in anymore. I want to care but how can I care for a place and a people shows no sign of interest in others, a flaky, fake nice, prejudiced people. I am sure there’s plenty of you that aren’t like this and feel the same way I do, my message to you is, don’t let this place brake you and narrow your vision of what you want, what you want could be waiting elsewhere.

duerd6c,"In the 15 years following the Australian confiscation, the homicide rate of the US dropped a LARGER PERCENTAGE than Australias did.

Our homicide rate has been higher than most developed nations since BEFORE they implemented strict gun control and since they have, we have CLOSED THE GAP, not increased it, despite adding 10s of millions of guns into circulation. Over the last 30 years we have gotten safer at a faster rate than the UK or Australia.

These are facts that you can calculate for yourself from any public data set of historical homicide rates.

EDIT: and to add, since gun deaths are usually including suicide deaths which make up the preponderance of them, another interesting fact since you mention it, is that the suicide rate in Japan is LARGER than the homicide AND suicide rate in the US.

ca5f85r,"Yeah. Buprenorphine is the chemical. It is a synthetic opioid that is extremely potent. It comes under the brand names subutex (without nalaxone added) and suboxone (with nalaxone added). Subutex is superior. Nalaxone is a substance administered for overdoses. It forces all opiates out of your brain receptors, putting you into precipitated withdrawals, reversing the overdose. In theory, it is supposed to prevent shooting subs, but in reality, it does nothing but add a bit of a headache and mild depressive feeling to the daily dose. I don't shoot subs, but I know most of my using friends do. 

Back to the bupe. It is an extremely potent opioid. If you give a non-addict even an eighth of a sub (which comes in 8mg pills or film-like strips), they will be throwing up the next 18 hours and wish that they had not tried to go macho on junky meds. It is a great way to teach people to respect drugs when you warn them and they don't listen. But, the thing is, it is extremely potent, binding all of your opiate receptors, but it does not make you high. It makes you feel like what a normal day without a habit would feel like. This is different than methadone. Methadone is also extremely potent, but it is also a good buzz and leaves you feeling like a zombie. Bupe allows a user to go about their days without withdrawal while feeling like a normal non-junky. 

Next, subs block you from being able to get high off recreational opiates by binding the receptors for about 18 hours, the half life. Because of this long half life, the sub will last most of the day. There is a threshold before it starts blocking though, around 2mg. That's why I said in a different post that I could use 1mg, which is not enough to go through a day, but I'd be able to use dope that night.

So:

* Potent opioid that completely eliminates symptoms of withdrawal 
* Cheaper than dope
* Very hard to OD on
* Not recreational, and so you just feel normal
* Long half life, so you stay well all day

Now you know the drug. There are two basic ways to use the drug. The first is the intended purpose. Take it every day for a long enough period of time that you can dissociate from the junky lifestyle and get used to not catching a nod/getting blasted with dope. It is the same idea as nicorette. 

The other way is to do a short taper. Quitting temporarily is much easier than quitting long term, and so that's why it is recommended to use subs long term. That being said, you can also do a short taper where you wait until you first go into withdrawals (if you take a full agonist opiate and then bupe after, you go into precipitated withdrawal, just like if you were given a shot of nalaxone), take a dose just large enough to stave off withdrawal, which is not much. I know people with gram a day iv habits that can get by with 2mgs. The stuff is even stronger than most junkies think, and most take too much. Then, you reduce your dosage over the next three to five days. Like 2-&gt;1.5-&gt;1-&gt;.5-&gt;.25 etc... Boom, you just quit dope, even if temporarily with minimal if any withdrawal. You may have to extend the taper, but no matter how large your habit, the same principal works. Maybe there are some junkies who need methadone because bupe just won't make them well, but I don't know anyone that bupe has not worked for. It really is a miracle drug. I don't see how one could be a functional addict without it.",comment,Atlanta,0.0

h41lg1k,"Full disclosure… I’m from riverside county and San Diego so not necessarily LA, but socal nonetheless. 

Work moved me from SD to Wisconsin a few years ago. I missed the food, the people, the atmosphere, climate, geography, literally everything EXCEPT costs. There was nothing to do in Wisconsin unless you liked to icefish and drink. It was relatively flat so no mountain biking or snowboarding. The lake was nice about 1 month out of the year. It got below freezing numerous occasions and they salt the roads during snowstorms so our cars started to rust. Overall, I would visit but never live there again. 

They’ve since moved me to SF, every once in a while I get to go back to SD and when I do I get this overwhelming sense of euphoria and nostalgia which drives me into a depression once I leave and all I can think about is how do I get out of my current arrangement and finally go back home for good.

Compared to SF, so cal is so much more… relaxed and it’s such a vibe. I literally just feel a breath of fresh air when I visit. Things are a bit more spaced out, people aren’t complete assholes, for the most part, you can actually hang out at the beach without freezing your ass off. The Mexican food is 100000x better down south. When I lived in riverside county it was perfect because the beach was an hour south, and snowboarding was an hour north. SD wasn’t bad either. I practically lived on the beach and snowboarding was more like 2 hours. Better than where I am now where beaches are 45ish and snowboarding is 3+ hours. However, the mountain biking here is phenomenal. 

So cal is home and I feel like I just jive down there and haven’t been able to find the same happiness anywhere else. Not WI, IL, NJ, NC, FL, or anywhere. I’ve thought about heading to Colorado, but then I visit socal again and just can’t resist the fact that it’s where I feel like I belong.",comment,LosAngeles,1.0

cz8a41x,"This doesn't *force* any property owner to increase the rate of their rental units. Property owners do not have some inalienable right to make the same amount of money every year, or increase their profit margins every year and they are **not** owed it purely for owning property. They feel they are because they've always done it and never had a substantial pushback. It happens at the expense of those that pay them. Unless wages or some other form of assistance keeps up with housing costs as a percentage of income, this has the unfortunate effect of pushing more and more people at low-hourly rates- minimum wage and not significantly higher- to live in communal situations a la roommates, or to ""fight"" over the comparatively fewer substandard and cheap rental units- think $700 or less for a studio.

This happens all over the city and the poor argument I see here often of 'Oh go move to a neighborhood that's not up and coming then' or even more short sighted 'Go move to another city/state/country then' doesn't hold up even as flimsily as it did when ""historically"" cheap neighborhoods start becoming not so cheap. The entirety of the Southside is catching up, too, and the rental rate gap between the North and South Sides is far smaller than it used to be even just a couple years ago.

Even a seemingly long-term action of moving to another city or state isn't as long-term as it appears. Places with studios and even 1 beds regularly under $700/Mo are often in places with low job potentials for those even with qualifications. Sure I can rent a 3-bed house in Gary for $500, but what am I going to do in Gary? There are no business giants in Gary. What then? The supermarket, the gas station down the road, a clerk at the liquor store that keeps the rest of the poor, depressed population in a drunken stupor? Guess what, me and everyone else in Gary would be doing the same thing, so even if I manage to snag a job there it probably won't be full-time or above minimum wage.
People work jobs like that because they **have to** or they don't get to actually live in a ""developed"" nation like the USA. Living in dense, urban areas like Chicago draws larger businesses and opens up the need for so many services that employ the millions of people that live in them.
The nebulous term 'market rate' and densely empty explanation of what it is is easy for rental property owners to hide behind when they just want some more cash. At this rate I wholly expect people to start suggesting that low-income people just move to an under-developed nation and become a farmer if they don't like it here.",comment,Chicago,0.0

hi9pjlc,"“In fact, the kind of robust treatment Ferraris and other skeptical law enforcement types are calling for is supposed to be on the way. Measure 110 will steer tens of millions of dollars toward more substance abuse treatment options around the state, most of that money derived from taxes on cannabis.

The state has already spent more than $30 million to help stabilize services. But the process of building up networks that can provide treatment, housing assistance, peer support and an array of other services to drug users throughout the state won’t begin in earnest until next year.

In the meantime, the Oregon Health Authority has contracted with Lines For Life, the Portland agency that runs hotlines to address substance abuse, suicidal thoughts, senior loneliness and more. The organization has created a special number to accept calls related to Measure 110, and has distributed tens of thousands of cards around the state that law enforcement officers are supposed to distribute when they issue a ticket.

“Received a citation for drug possession?” the cards read. “You can avoid paying the $100 fine by completing a free health screening with Lines for Life.”

Police leaders like Hensman and Medford Police Chief Scott Clauson say their officers always provide the hotline number when handing out possession tickets. If that’s true, they’re not having much effect.

According to Holton, the Lines for Life CEO, the hotline had completed 51 screenings as of Oct 13. It had received nearly as many hang ups: 37.

Discussing the hotline’s relative disuse this summer, Holton said the situation posed concerns but that future tweaks — for instance, ensuring that every ticket issued for drug possession has the hotline number printed on it — could lead to major improvement. But by mid-October, his worries had grown.

Grants Pass police, Holton noted, already include a hotline number on their tickets, and have issued more than almost any other agency. But calls trickle in from Grants Pass at about the same rate as other areas.

“If people are being given the right numbers and not calling us,” Holton said, “that suggests a systemic problem.” “


So the best we’ve got now is a fucking hotline no one uses. That’s what we get for millions of dollars. It’s working so great so far better not hurry the fuck up and actually set up addiction treatment services. 

I’m dealing with this shit first hand my mom is a drug addict. She won’t go to treatment because all it’s ever been is her sitting in a room sweating it out with a bunch of other junkies.

kiclf28,"First, the cancer thing is a really pathetic strawman. How about actually addressing my points?

Second, you're not arguing in good faith. It was very clear that I was speaking in broader terms than this one store or incidence. The very first sentence of my statement conceded that your point about unionization could very well be valid. I was simply stating that your argument that theft isn't an issue was not helping your cause. There is a reason they're able to hide behind that.

Look...

Do you mind if I ask what part of Portland you live in and how long you have been a resident of Portland? How much have you traveled.

I've been all over the country. I'm also a seventh generation Oregonian, third generation Portlander, and was a forty-year resident of Portland. I've lived in St. Johns, Lents, Hawthorn, Hollywood, Cedar Hills, and Rockwood, to name a few. I grew up on the streets of Portland as a homeless teen. I'm intimately familiar with the city in a way that isn't possible for most people.

I was also a professional shoplifter as a child to support myself, and I worked numerous retail jobs in my teens and twenties. I've also worked security and loss prevention, so I know more about theft than most, too.

Over my life, I have watched Portland go from a relatively small city depressed from the collapse of the logging industry, to a model for the country of what a revitalized urban area looked like, to whatever the fuck it is today with shit in the streets and fentanyl zombies roaming around. 

I am so sick of assholes moving into Portland to tell me this is all totally normal. It's not! Portland, fuck, the whole country, is in crisis, and I am so... fucking... sick... of people saying it's not.

Just watch, I'll get downvoted into oblivion for even suggesting that mass theft, shit in the streets, and shanty towns arn't normal. I don't give a shit, though. This isn't normal, and I am tired of what are mostly economic migrants fleeing crime and poverty in California saying otherwise

I remember when Portland had one of the lowest murder rates in the country. Now, we're celebrating a small drop after a two-fold increase. This is not fucking normal!

Theft, crime, homeless are pretty major issues. I don't give a fuck about a closing store. If Portland wasn't so fucked right now, there wouldn't even be an argument to be made about theft. I bet you they have the numbers to back that shit up now, though.

Seriously, Portlanders need to get their fucking shit together, hold their leaders accountable, and demand better. Otherwise, there will be a lot more stores closing, and the reason on the paper isn't going to make one bit of difference to those without a job or those who can't get goods and services.

And it has to be done at the rank and file level - big city police departments have repeatedly tried to bring in a progressive or reform minded chief to turn things around, and it almost always fails

diphzyb,"Oh, the cop's gun jammed?

The way a gun works is very simple, including pistols.   Dunno about 4 cycles, not a mechanic.

Bullet casing must be locked into a fixed position very close to trigger pin (like 1-2mm away) and a significant amount of pressure from the firing pin must strike the cap (or side if it's rimfire).   On a pistol this is just physically impossible to do if the gun is already jammed.  Almost always the jam is the chambered round sticking the slide closed because it's out of line and not properly seated where it's supposed to be, ready to fire.   Pull trigger and the pin just punches and retracts into empty space or doesn't hit the cap.

Small jams can be cleared by partially resetting the slide (grip back of slide with thumbs, move it back and forth).   Worst jams need a full slide open, or a mag pop... and if it's anything like a Sig 224 I own which jams on every single round---I bring a screwdriver with me because I'm gonna need it.

If cop says his gun jammed and *then* the gun fired, it only fired because he cleared the jam himself and then depressed the trigger.   That could have been muscle memory and he's foggy about what happened, but if those are the facts presented, the physics of pistols any experienced gun owner will tell you---a jam doesn't clear-fire on a police issued Glock or a Sig.

I do own a dirty rimfire rifle that can knock off a couple extra rounds on its own on a trigger depress if one of the rounds jams... but when that happens it will jam again (rifle is a .22 knock off, they're like that), but rifles are different.   Shotguns are very, very different and it's very easy to create a jam on them and make ammo explode inside a locked chamber if you're a stupid person.

But no matter what type of gun, there are no such things as self-firing guns that city cops carry around with them, much less perps, much less law-abiding gun owners, that fire without a trigger depress.  Even if you drop it on the ground--it will never ""go off"". 

If bullet entered suspect, it game from a gun, and when that round left the muzzle there was an object, likely a human finger, holding down and depressing a trigger.   Always.   It never happens any other way.   Trigger pins don't move and have a life of their own.",comment,Philadelphia,1.0
huxvmkw,"I honestly did not know how bad our situation was for access to mental healthcare until I became good friends with someone that (1) was bipolar and (2) moved to Houston to stay with her sister.  This was someone that frequently had suicidal thoughts and had recently been in the middle of a depressive phase, so it was vital to get her proper care as soon as possible.

Compared to New Jersey, where she was from, Houston was abysmal, both in availability/selection of care and the process for securing it - the fact that she was unemployed and on Medicaid made everything that much more difficult, as if she were being punished for her situation with a sledgehammer of bureaucracy.  I would later learn that Texas ranked dead last in the US for access to mental healthcare.

This is as much an indictment of national policy as it is of Texas specifically.  The combination of mostly-unchecked capitalism being the foundation of our ""healthcare"" system, and either indifference or insufficient will from our political leaders to rectify things, needs to be swept away and replaced.

Hello! this is a serious pickle, and id like the preface that i'm helping my roommate out of this situation who was too depressed to deal with this situation when it first happened but I want to help and find a resolution. Please keep the judgements minimal, he was in a really tough space and I just want to help get what I can from it for him. i'll keep it short and factual. My friends PC rig, most of his clothing and belongings were in this vehicle.

Car was purchased by my friend in CASH but with bill of sale as proof. Owner of car framed it as being helpful for my friends case if he paid cash for it and fell for the tale. Friend did not get around to officially transferring the title to his name at the registry because it was towed off the streets for blocking something within the week. Friend called Lincoln Towing to inquire about his vehicle. The lady said it was sold at auction which he didn't believe because the car could have only been gone for couple days at this point. He calls again next day, a different lady clears up that it had NOT been sold at auction but its owner had come to pick it up.

So at this point we now can assume that the guy he bought it from likely got the notification of its towing and went to take it back, right? He reaches out to the original seller of the vehicle, inquiring about its whereabouts. He is wishywashy, wont say outright that he has the vehicle or what we can do to get it back but being overall rude about the situation and not sounding like he wants to hand it back over. 

So you might say easy solution would have been to contact police or seek council right? Well my friend found this situation very overwhelming at the time, it was basically the only thing he had left at this point and in his eyes it was taken from him with his belongings. He didn;t think bill of sale would be enough to prove to the law that it was his. So he left the situation alone. So its been about 7 months since he reached out to the original seller.

&#x200B;

What can we do in this situation? anything of value my friend had was in that truck. He doesn't have money for a lawyer. He has the physical keys to the vehicle, some pictures of him in it and the bill of sale as his only proof of being the rightful owner for it.",submission,Seattle,1.0

I love the walkability of being in Center City and the access to great restaurants/bars, but that’s about it. The roads are so bad it’s a joke. The amount of trash literally everywhere still shocks me after 4 years. The complete lack of policing even the most blatant crimes — the fact that K&amp;A is allowed to exist is disgusting. The overall shitty attitude of people here — drivers, pedestrians, retail/restaurant workers, etc. How much of a pain in the ass/how much more it costs to purchase alcohol. The endless depressing grey days. The lack of outdoor activities/how long it takes to get to what is available.

I could get a lot more in depth, but there’s no point. It’s not all bad here and I obviously understand no city is perfect (I’ve lived in quite a few major cities over the past ~12 years), but Philly isn’t the place for the lifestyle I want to live.",comment,Philadelphia,1.0
k760enp,"Let's be clear about a few things, and respectfully, don't put words I never said in my mouth.

>To say Gaza is free and therefore you don’t understand what “Free Palestine” means 

and

>our characterization of “They voted for it they deserve it” is so far off. 

No, I never said nor implied the latter. And I'm not saying Gaza is free. I'm saying ""Free Palestine"" can mean many things and most protestors don't actually know what it means nor the complex history that actually lead up to the events of today. I sympathize with the civilians there who have no recourse. But you need to understand a few things you're missing. Yes, there is a naval blockade and it's been in place since 2007. But do you know what happened between 2005 and 2007 though? After its withdrawal, Israel gradually loosened the blockade. Meanwhile, the ""Unity"" government made up of Hamas and Fatah began clashing and fighting for power, with even Arab nations at the time recognizing Hamas' post-election takeover in Gaza as a violent coup. And at the same time, rockets being shot into Israel and suicide bombings were on the rise again with weapons and material to make weapons consistently intercepted by the blockade, so any laxing of the blockade was reversed. 

So I agree, Gaza is not free, but what does ""Free Palestine"" mean? Last time there was a withdrawal and the blockade loosened, it was exploited and dozens of Israeli civilians were killed. If ""Free Palestine"" means eliminating the blockade that regularly intercepts weapons, Palestine will never be free until they have a government that can be trusted and probably one that doesn't have a charter that asserts Israel will only exist until Islam obliterates it by means of jihad.

Similarly, on your note of self determination, the last time Palestine had a leader that was willing to come to the table and negotiate was 20 years ago, and an offer for self determination, a two-state solution, their own governance, was rejected because they didn't want to share Jerusalem. 

So, again, I don't think Palestine is free, you'll never catch me saying that and I reject any argument based on your notion that I am saying that. I very much empathize with Palestinian civilians and I think they've been dealt a horrible hand. But in modern times, look at literally any coordinated military event inn the past 50 years that resulted in Palestinian casualties, you'll see that 100% of the time Israel's reaction was in direct response to something. Yom Kippur War, Operation Protective Edge, First and Second Lebanon Wars, Operation Cast Lead, Grapes of Wrath, Pillar Defense, Lebanon War, October 7th... so many others, all in direct response to deadly violence against Israel.  It's truly a shame that there are civilians who are getting stuck in the crossfire here, it really is upsetting. But what is a nation in that position supposed to do? So when I hear ""Free Palestine"", what I hear is ""Don't retaliate or defend yourself or take protective measures against a hostile government with a track record of deadly strikes against almost exclusively civilian populations.""",comment,NYC,1.0

dyfbx18,"I very much agree with most of what you wrote. Tbh I think the first course of action is just properly funding background check orgs. I get that most shootings aren’t carried out with ARs and suicide is the highest gun killer, but we also see a trend that isn’t surprising: if you use a weapon more appropriately designed for combat use, you probably kill more people when that is your intent. So, I still believe there’s a class of weapon that increases a semi-trained person’s *external* deadliness to a degree that it should only be in the hands of military (or police or an honorably discharged vet or someone otherwise vetted). And I don’t want them banned so much as limited by special license, maybe a lifetime qualification barring revocation, with penalties for loss/theft that other classes of firearms don’t carry. Or maybe they should require a liability insurance rider or something. We could never attempt to prevent suicides with an assault weapons limit, it’s solely about limiting the overall deadliness of an intentional shooter from a cold stats/public health-type perspective. It seems intuitive but it requires drawing a line somewhere that is difficult to draw. But, we do draw and maintain similar and even more complex systems of laws for buildings, cars, fire retardant in furniture, and baby crib design - all in response to tragic trends. We should be able to define and limit the holding of combat-intended arms for public safety sensibly so nobody’s rights are unjustly infringed upon.

My little brother, Ian, ([speaks_for_trees](http://www.reddit.com/user/Speaks_for_Trees)) left on Boxing Day, right after Christmas, to spend New Years in Times Square with some people he didn't know very well.  They spoke another language from him and apparently he felt alienated, and on the 30th he simply... walked away.

[And no one knows where he is.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/185598631539107/)

He left his phone, his wallet, his laptop, his trees, his iPod, and all his money.  He did NOT leave his ID, a jacket, or the Metro card he bought... we believe these items were on him.

g6g92f2,"It was obvious to the psychiatrist that you wanted to get a prescription for a controlled substance and she was not having it. By disagreeing with her diagnosis of severe depression, you only further have marked yourself as someone who is seeking drugs, not seeking help. Remember that a psychiatrist is a full on medical doctor first, and their mental health training comes second. Adderall is a pretty serious script and a good psychiatrist won't prescribe it unless it's a last resort. 

Follow the advice given and answer the questions honestly. If you feel no effects from welbutrin, she'll probably have you try another medication. Do not argue with a psychiatrist, ever, because like most doctors they think anyone who questions them lacks intelligence. Eventually, if therapy or other medications don't help your symptoms, she will try harder drugs. 

Definitely seek out some kind of non-medication therapy, such as CBT, DBT, or regular counseling. Look for someone who specifically has experience with helping people who struggle to stay on task or who struggle in school.

I had severe depression and it made me unable to focus on work, because work stressed me out so much my brain would go into panic mode and I wanted to run away from everything that was difficult. Getting put on antidepressants eliminated my worst symptoms. I still struggle at work to stay organized, stay on task, and to take on hard things without running away, so I also am in talk therapy to identify ways to approach work and to hold myself accountable.

There's no quick fix for mental health issues. Heavy medication will cause as many problems as it solves. I actually was given a script for Ritalin because of attention and energy issues, and if I'm not in the right headspace while I'm taking it, it basically turns out like [this comic](https://i.redd.it/jrb4e1wr9ll31.png).

l0klm8x,"I don't know if you know this, but you sound terrifically condescending. And you are absolutely incorrect on many of your points. Your apnea is not the same as the OPs hypersomnia. Not even close. People with narcolepsy and hypersomnia disorders CAN NOT CONTROL their sleep. Hypersomnias are a neurological issue that can be managed with medication but cannot be cured. The latest research is pretty clear that narcolepsy and the hypersomnias are autoimmune conditions which can be passed down genetically. They can also be triggered, for instance by the Pandemrix vaccine in Sweden in the early 2000s.

Because the issue regards sleep, those with these disorders are generally considered lazy by people who have typical sleep patterns. People who have difficulty falling asleep, waking up, or who  have a circadian rhythm disorder that causes them to be awake/asleep at atypical times are subject to cultural shame from people who have never experienced this as a daily disorder and don't know what it's like to have a sleep attack. (It's not unlike fainting. People with hypersomnia disorders can feel a sleep attack coming on but are unable to stop it, nor can they control when they come out of it.) There is no such thing as a ""device to keep you more alert."" The current treatment is GHB (brand name Xyrem) to put you to sleep at night, and amphetamines or other stimulants to keep you awake during the day. If a person has a comorbid condition, such as a heart murmurs or arythmias, high or low blood pressure, anxiety attacks, (etc.) or is trying to conceive, or has had addiction issues, or just simply doesn't want to take GHB, they are unable to take the medication that is current best practice. There is currently no medical treatment other than these medications, which are used to alleviate symptoms but are in no way a cure. 

Also, home sleep tests are able to check oxygen levels heart rate and awakenings, which is why they're used for apnea. But, because they don't involve the EEG necessary to diagnose a neurological disorder,  they are basically useless for diagnosing narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia. A patient has to visit an MD who specializes in sleep medicine and who can provide the in-house sleep study, which  lasts overnight and into the next day for the MSLT (Multi Sleep Latency Test). It is uncomfortable, expensive, and insurance rarely covers it. Medications can also be jaw-droppingly expensive and are not generally covered. In some cases the MD won't prescribe Xyrem without use of a CPAP, which is another expense that insurance is unlikely to cover. 

According to the NIH, it  takes, on average, 10 years to get a narcolepsy or  hypersomnia diagnosis. Because medical schools don’t educate MDs about sleep disorders, and because these disorders can't be found with the common blood tests (though studies show a spinal tap can be helpful with diagnosis), patients--particularly if they're young or female-- are generally dismissed as depressed.

The hypersomnias are serious, life-altering disorders that can affect all aspects of daily living. The accommodations can include late starts or flexible scheduling, scheduled breaks long enough for 20 to 30 minute rests (part of the sleep hygene protocol for the hypersomnias), and the ability to go on break/put head down and rest if a person feels an attack coming on. 

All of this information is available online. Telling a person with this disorder or any other disorder to ""get their ducks in a row"" is offensive af, and shows just how little you know about what it feels like to live with this this type of disorder. I also question the idea that this type of dismissal, which involved humiliating the OP, and potentially causing children emotional distress or triggering feelings of abandonment, was warranted.

You have lost the point of this thread.

That tent does not belong to some previously functional tech bro who used it twice at Burning Man (as someone else humorously suggested). Obviously the person in that tent has more issues than homelessness, and it is almost certainly some combination of mental health and addiction, along with the resulting lack of social support that happens as familial structures fail mentally ill people.

My point was that I’m fortunate to be part of an extended family structure that is currently supporting 3 different family members who could be the person in that tent, except that we are willing and able to care for them. Their issues aren’t about “housing” — their issues are about end-stage capitalism and rage and depression. 

How are we going to treat that? Because it’s only going to get worse as climate collapse happens. 

I think people in SF (and on this subreddit) are frustrated that the only suggested solution to people sleeping in the streets is low cost housing. Putting a psychotic person in an apartment by themselves does not treat psychosis. The guy who just murdered another elderly Asian woman is a person with untreated mental illness. His core issue is not homelessness; in fact, he is probably housed. By not being able to perceive the difference between these issues, we have lost the ability to address the real problems.

We are frustrated that a person gets to sleep and shit on the sidewalk in front of our houses but we can’t park our cars on the sidewalk in front of our garage because it “obstructs the sidewalk”.

fj12h42,"&gt; Capitalism with restraints is a paradoxical suggestion. A system that incentivizes leeching off of workers is only restrained by working towards its abolition. I am wary of someone like Warren who is too naive or obtuse to confront the brutal reality of wage-slavery: Corporate success under a capitalist system depends on a disenfranchised, racialized, and economically depressed labor pool. 

Isn't 'capitalism with restraints' generally how the economies of Sweden/Denmark/Norway/Finland work, and are generally the examples Bernie always gives for what he wants to replicate? 

Of course I shouldn't insinuate that you necessarily want to replicate these systems, but I guess the point I'm making is that Bernie tends to support the systems present in Scandinavian social democracies; but I (and many economists) would argue this system is far to capitalism than they are 'socialism' at a fundamental level.",comment,Boston,1.0

Mental illness is really terrible, having suffered from anxiety and depression, my heart goes out to anyone in a suicidal situation.

Having to drink to sleep, I was waking up in the middle of the night after the alcohol wore off in a full on panic attack thinking quite seriously about killing myself. Fortunately, I'm doing well these days but those were some dark times. I am actually a supporter of assisted suicide for the terminally ill but a suicidal person on a bridge isn't in a mental place to give consent.

Gun violence is simply not common, it just looks that way because we see it on TV all the time and hear it from politicians with an agenda. Furthermore, most of gun deaths are suicides, and of the non-suicide deaths, 90% of those are pistol violence. Rifle violence is a negligible rounding error. 

I don't want to minimize the seriousness of those deaths, but if you listened to the media and the government bureaucrats, you'd think there was a gun violence epidemic out there.

I personally appreciate your attempt to communicate with me.We have assigned police a impossible job they are absolutely not equipped, nor trained to solve humanely. This has resulted in dangerous losses to the legitimacy of law. Respect and trust for police officers has been statistically lost by the enforcement of this system of injustice. By reallocating police focus into violent crimes, and away from victimless ones of varying kinds, you restore this legitimacy and trust in law. I think law is worthy of neither respect or the impression of coherence where it imprisons the greatest percentage in history,  or imprisons the greatest number in the history of man, its not a coherent just or sensible thing to do.How do you want me as a citizen to deal with this?

Note: To the police officers of my town, I am a generally law abiding citizen afraid of you, you are 12 times as likely to shoot me as a mass shooter, you imprison 1700/100000, police brutalize protesters, police use chemical weapons(tear gas) on their non violent neighbors, police clubs are well worn from the brutalization police've imposed, black people are 5% of sf 55% of imprisoned,  police are four times as likely to commit suicide than any other line of duty death. Being anywhere near you is scary especially the psychological danger of being part of such a sociopathic violent militarized community abusing your own neighbors in industrialized mass.

gb8aj2c,"/u/jaded_toast said it, the perception that Chinese food has to be ludicrously inexpensive to be worth it is really unfair and is what is tanking Chinatown right now.

I'm a chef.  I grew up in a Chinese restaurant in New York and I've worked in Michelin-starred restaurants in NYC for the last 10 years.

There is barely any fundamental difference between ravioli and dumplings but the former can go for anywhere from $15-40 per plate of 6, but the average person thinks $15 for 20 frozen dumplings or $8 for 6 cooked and served, is too expensive.

Minimum wage hike to $15 was very painful to all restaurants, we had to completely change the way restaurants were run.  Food is more expensive than ever and we all know rent in NYC is insane.  I've been helping to keep our family's restaurant in Fresh Meadows alive, it costs $500 a month to get your garbage picked up ONCE a week.  Running a restaurant is dumb and really challenging to make a living off of.

Please continue to support Chinatown, the Chinese demographic in New York City is very much entrenched in the lowest income bracket and we started tanking in January when the xenophobia and racism towards China was at its apex.  Chinese restaurants in this country have been suffering depressed sales for over a year now.  They won't last much longer, look at Lam Zhou, despite enormous community support, they couldn't keep it going.

I know it won't change overnight, and it will likely be my life's mission to keep fighting this negative perception, but please don't complain about $15 for 20 dumplings.  As someone who has made thousands of dumplings and also sheeted and pressed thousands of agnolotti, the skill and technique involved in making good dumplings is just as impressive.

Coming from the west is just suicide, particularly from Simi since there's only road into the valley from there. Coming from the south makes the most sense since you'd want to take out Pendleton and take San Onofre first. There's also less mountains in the way.

The best strategy is to simply besiege it or if you've completely lost your mind, nuke it. You could also try to take it as fast as possible and encourage as many civilians to fuck off as possible so they don't become guerillas. Defending forces have to deal with the refugees as you use the concrete jungle to your advantage. A southern approach will make people flee north and clog up all those chokepoint freeways making a counterattack bogged down by all the cars. The highway system was built to respond to invasion and by clogging them up with refugees negates that.

It’s got a full kitchen, but even as a professional chef I don’t find much use for a 5 burner gas range when using even one burner or, god forbid, the oven, raises the temp of the unit 25 degrees. Not to mention the problem with having your bed, at most, 2 feet from oil splatter and kitchen sink splatter and just regular kitchen mess stuff.

Very similar things can be said about Seattle. However, I don't think I'll move back east where I grew up. Small town with lots of brain drain and very few good jobs around, but a lot of the same things happen. Old haunts shut down and new ones take their place. Natural disasters happen, out there it was flooding and pollution (which flooding makes worse). The homeless community just... disappears? I'm not sure where they're sent or if they are better at putting people into local housing because CoL is far lower. The big cities nearby have similar issues with homelessness. The cops there are generally reasonable (honestly after moving to the big city the biggest shock was how terrible the city PD can be).

I have some level of depression and always will. My perspective may differ because I grew up somewhere that was always kind of shitty from my adult perspective (like one of the lowest CoL in the entire country, constantly being flooded, and dealing with a century old pollution problem shitty). Things change and change is the only constant.

I hate asking as I'm sure there is a post just like this somewhere, but I made my homework and read many of the posts.

* I'll be working in Chelsea.
* I was budgeting like 4500 a month for rent.
* Important to me is for the apartment to have good light, be quiet, relatively accessible to things as I want to explore the city a lot since it's gonna be the first year of living there.
* 1br, I don't want a studio.

All the apartments I saw on StreetEasy in the WV and Chelsea look like prison cells with no light and a tiny kitchenette. It's really depressing. I thought maybe instead pick up a place elsewhere in Manhattan and just take the damn subway because that's the whole point of it.

I saw some nice listings for places in Hells Kitchen but I was looking as close to 8th ave as possible to be close to the subway, not the projects near the Lincoln Tunnel that people say are HK's armpit, but still people say it's full of tourists and soulless.

So people, where do people live? How can I realistically find a normal place that won't make me completely depressed?

h0ltwx,"Why I Lost SFPD's Number I thought about telling this story for the past year, and San Francisco POA’s tweet about losing their number today got me to do so. This story is about the time I called the police for a welfare check in 2019. I had traveled by bicycle and was 15 minutes away from home when I received a suicide message from my girlfriend, and within a minute phone calls from multiple friends of hers. Fifteen minutes felt too long to wait, so I called the police hoping they could reach my apartment before I did.

To really frame the terrible experience I had with SFPD, I feel the need to discuss what it’s like interacting with the fire department without the police around. Lending context, I had volunteered with a combined fire and rescue department in Maine 8 years prior. In 2018 she had suffered a concussion away from home and called me. I picked her up, brought her home, and recognized the symptoms of an increasingly shortening short term memory loop… the same questions asked over and over again.

When I made that call, SFFD arrived with an ambulance and a fire engine. I had up to this point provided  medical care briefing the Paramedic on basic vitals and symptoms and calming the patient / my girlfriend who is pretty distrustful of hospitalization. One of the other Paramedic/FF crew from the engine was trying to take the route of pushing via an IV sedative medicine in place of working with the patient, agitating her in the process. Neither was particularly great for a traumatic brain injury case. The ambulance paramedic told me later on the ride to the hospital that he directed the other fire crew member to not join for the ride to the hospital and took me due to effective patient care.

In contrast, the 2019 call I made for the suicide attempt has the same buzz of activity as last time, plus police officers. On the coffee table in front of me is several liquors and a collection of household substances that all warrant poison control center numbers. My girlfriend was awakened, now conscious on the couch, agitated about being taken to hospital. I took a photograph of everything found laying on the coffee table for the staff at the hospital to know what they’re working with. I started talking to her trying to discern if I can understand what she took in which amounts because there’s such a collection including bug spray.

I’m trying to work with the paramedics again, talking with her as a patient, and I’ve got a SFPD police officer in my ear. He wants me to pay attention to him. He wants to take my phone from me. I tell him that he can get things for his report later. He can’t take my phone and have control of it. I tell him no. He grabs my wrist and pushes me towards the door of my apartment. He tells me that he’ll handcuff me outside of my apartment until this is all done if I don’t cooperate with him now. He interferes with me trying to get medical attention for my girlfriend. The police officer, who walked in the door with me when I arrived, is acting in every way to make things worse.

In talking about systemic racism, there’s an inherent acknowledgement that as a white male, I’m probably getting the “best” of the department’s behavior. Still, having made the phone call, unlocked the door, and having the officer see the exact same situation for every minute I’m home, I’m being treated with contempt of cop. The reaction is an officer so convinced that in the face of my being concerned about somebody possibly dying that he is the most important person in the room and being told, “No,” and, “Later,” warrant placing me in handcuffs.

I’m in a different apartment and relationship now. Earlier this week, I watched somebody outside my window with an angle grinder trying to defeat the locks and security on a scooter. As somebody who enjoys bicycling for transit, a person with an angle grinder committing theft is one of my least favorite folks in the world. In any other story I’d leave it with no further description of the person, but it seems that saying he was a white male is relevant. I didn’t call the police because I don’t trust them, certainly not with anybody of color but ultimately… not with anybody at all.

I was at three protests this week. I’m surprised and pleased at how SFPD handled them without firing any riot control weaponry that I’m aware of. The kudos for not beating people down in the streets feel hollow, though. I remember 2 years ago when a security guard at Whole Foods tried to taze somebody 20 feet away from him and running away in the street… and the police officer standing there backed the security guard when I called it out. I remember being threatened with handcuffs in my own home trying to do my best to make sure my girlfriend was saved. I remember every time a police officer parks carelessly in the bicycle lane, halfway in a parking spot, halfway in the lane, sitting in the idling vehicle, too above it all to care about putting in the smallest amount of effort to not obstruct other people.

I lost SFPD’s phone number last year, and I continue to find reasons to do so this week.",submission,SanFrancisco,1.0

c1q5iea,"I'm in a totally unrelated grad program, but I moved to Seattle from southern California for grad school and I love it here. I did my undergrad at an extremely small private college, so I'm blown away by the kind of resources UW has (and depressed by the rate at which they're vanishing as the budget gets cut, ugh).

I'm pretty quiet and I like to live someplace pretty quiet, so I live in Eastlake. It's not terribly popular with students because there is absolutely NO night life and not much day life either, but it's smack in between the U district and Capitol Hill and it's a very short bus ride to either one, so it suits me perfectly. And I can walk or ride the bus to campus, which is important because parking on campus is prohibitively expensive.

Everyone who says the weather sucks is right: The weather here sucks. Summer is gorgeous but the entire rest of the year is basically a 9-month slog of varying degrees of gray, soggy awfulness. I generally start rage-facing about the weather around month six and bitch continuously until summer.

co1ld0p,"You're trying to say that cities and counties have arbitrary borders that correspond the historical situation rather than the situation today, no? Well, viewing it as a single human settlement makes just as little sense. After all, it's a single human settlement where a majority of people interact with other elements of the settlement, but that isn't really the case. In only a few areas, surrounded by larger areas that are not involved, is this the case. So characterizing all of Cobb County as ""Atlanta"" is an arbitrary situation that simply doesn't reflect the reality of the situation.

&gt; This strikes me as a counterproductive attitude.

In a sense I agree with you. It's a shame that trying the alternative has worked out so consistently badly for us.

&gt; Have Roswell, North Fulton, and the metro area as a whole not prospered since Fulton rescued Milton?

In the immediate term it did benefit Fulton and Milton. Do you know who it didn't benefit? The county that lost its second largest population center and tax base. Cobb County lost a very significant part of the county in exchange for nothing. It wasn't even necessary, given that Fulton and Milton already had a border but the state added Cobb County east of Willeo Creek to sweeten the pot and make access easier.

Moreover, given how North Fulton led the charge on the Balkanization of the metropolitan area, fighting for the incorporation of various parts of the area for more than four decades since, it's pretty clear that they feel that the area has prospered *in spite of* rather than *because of* Great Depression Era political machination. I mean, Sandy Springs tried to get itself annexed by the functionally non-functional town incorporated to protect East Cobb from further annexation attempts in order to get out. 

Cobb County has been pointed excluded from things ranging from the Olympics to the annexation of Roswell to regional commissions yet people are surprised when we aren't jumping all over ourselves to integrate more.

k90ligu,"According to the professor whose quotes were removed for an unexplained reason:

> When asked to offer historical context on the word “intifada,” Reed Professor Marat Grinberg — a scholar of Jewish history and the author of several books, including The Soviet Jewish Bookshelf: Jewish Culture and Identity Between the Lines — said that, “Intifada stands for violence against Israel and Jews; there were two intifadas – waves of violent uprisings and terror against Israelis in the 1980s and early 2000s which are responsible for the deaths of 1,000 innocent civilians. Suicide bombings which devastated the Israeli society were part of this. The whole point of the peace process between Israel and Palestinians, which started in the 1990s and led to the establishment of Palestinian authority [sic] in the West Bank, is that Palestinians would renounce violence and stop terror.”

> Professor Grinberg continued, “by saying ‘there is only one solution, intifada revolution’ and ‘mobilize the intifada,’ [slogans used later in the protest] these protesters condone and legitimize the unspeakable terror Hamas inflicted on the Israeli civilians and call for perpetual violence against them. And it is antisemitic – it threatens and is directed against Jewish lives.” Professor Grinberg also said that, “‘Intifada everywhere’ … means violence against Jews (and deadly violence at that) everywhere, beyond Israel. This is unadulterated antisemitism. Bias reports must be filed.”",comment,Portland,1.0

Can anybody recommend any psychiatrists in Austin who are familiar with adderall abuse and/or depression with marked anhedonia that is likely caused by said adderall usage? Therapists who specialize in the latter (how to treat depression/anhedonia caused by dysfunctional reward pathways due to long term adderall use) would be especially helpful. Also if they take BCBS of TX, ha.

My situation is so specialized and precarious my seeming best course of action is to try to find 3-4 psychiatrists familiar with this situation and get a sort of collective take before deciding what sort of treatment program to enter.

For a little background - I’m a special case in that I’ve had varying levels of depression for decades and adderall has been one of the only meds that elevates my mood in a way that makes me functional. But I recognize I probably accidentally got into a bad place with my adderall usage recently and need to detox from it for a few weeks or months. However I also recognize my underlying depression is likely to persist and I will eventually need adderall treatment.

dvxdyhz,"I’m a licensed clinical social worker who works on Skid Row. Many of these people are homeless due to mental illness and/or the job market and affordable housing issues. Substance abuse is a secondary issue; as it is a maladaptive coping mechanism (which sometimes also has led them to homelessness).

Sadly enough, I also see and treat a plethora of homeless families living without severe and persistent mental illness and without substance abuse disorders. These are families who can’t maintain a home whilst a single parent is only making $8-12/hour. There is also a LOT of domestic violence which leads to homelessness as well. These are people who are depressed/anxious/traumatized because they are homeless, and not the other way around.

It runs the whole gamut, but housing is a HUGE problem and it is only getting worse.

jt97xzq,"I’m a mental health therapist who relocated here here two years ago with my wife who’s a nurse. She does wound care for mostly unhoused folks and largely folks who are multi substance substance users. The scene here is grim. Not enough services, period. Case management here is a struggle, between housing shortages, a real lack of any graduated care system that’s in any way effective and a plentiful supply of a relatively cheap drug that causes psychosis quick. 

Folks who have money can get treatment, but that’s been the case for a long time everywhere. I worry for my suicidal clients because the only mental health specific hospital in the area has a record of not protecting patients from other violent patients (on their front lawn even). Most of my safety plans include other interventions unless some is ODing or bleeding out.  

Does the sign on bonus require a time commitment in order to receive it? My wife had to agree to stay at her hospital for a few years I think in order to get hers. If you haven’t visited Portland and chatted with a few nurses, I’d suggest that first. 

You will be working with a lot of unhoused folks if you move here in this field. It’s depressing, frustrating, and many people express a lack of empathy for unhoused folks with addictions’ struggle. 

Union nurses were striking for increased pay and better staffing ratios, which apparently can be pretty awful currently. 

I work in private practice and I am always full, even though I don’t accept insurance and I’ve been practicing for 20 years so my rates are high. 

You will always have employment if you move here in your field, and SUDS work is largely the same everywhere I think.

113goa0,"Should I Let My Neighbor Borrow Money After Our First Conversation? I'm generally wondering if other Chicagoans would lend their neighbor money if asked, even if they don't know the neighbor very well.

A little context for my specific situation:

I bought my home on the Southwest side a year and a half ago. I've gotten to know my neighbor to the left of my building fairly well and we've gotten to the point where we often chat, exchange food, and give small gifts. The house to the right of me has an extended family (grandparents, their children, grandchildren) with about 7 people living there. They're generally nice neighbors and very quiet, but I have never had a significant conversation with anyone there outside of waving or exchanging phone numbers when we first moved in. I'm not opposed to befriending them, but it just seems they prefer to keep to themselves and our relationship hasn't developed in the same way.

I was walking home from work earlier this week and went over to say hi to one of the neighbors in that house because they were on their porch. I asked how he had been doing and he told me he had been struggling with anxiety &amp; depression. Then, he wanted to know if he could borrow $50 from me for a few weeks to buy some medicine to treat it. This request caught me off-guard because I felt like I was being put on the spot. I told him that I generally don't loan money out, but I would think about it. He said he understood and it was okay, but the whole situation make me feel very awkward and like I was being selfish.

Would you lend money in this situation? I'm considering going back on it and giving him the $50 as a gift to prevent any animosity in the future. However, I also don't want to set a precedent and have him coming to me for cash every time he needs it.",submission,Chicago,1.0

gxax3ik,"no violent criminals not necessarily needs to be accepted into society. There is a reason why people go through a life time of prison, many are going right now. I agree we need a framework for handling mentally ill criminals and before that need to have mental health help available to everyone. But this country wont be doing that unless people lean more left.

The preventive measures are to give everyone a good-ish life so they dont beat themselves into a serious mental illness. Till we reach that level of consensus in society, we have to keep them in prison or other similar facilities. 

Education and housing can solve these issues. But we never focus on it. Instead the school board is worried about removing Lincoln's name from school. Ugh.

Like guns or hate them its part of this constitution and part of why this country was founded. Organizations like the NRA have to lobby to protect our rights to combat people like maura Healey who will flat out ban things with no knowledge of what shes talking about. If you dont remember that ""reinterpretation"" of the ""assault rifle ban"" was rewritten twice after it went into effect. A majority of the politicians that try to ban these weapons know nothing about them and band them simply because of cosmetic features.

If you dont beleive me, look up how a ruger Mini 14 functions and tell me why those are legal and AR15s are not. Handguns account for a vadt majority of deaths but they are legal? And most are semi auto(obviously not revolvers). These arguements are driven by fear not logic. 

I understand firearms are not for everyone and you dont beleive in them. Clearly I get that. People use them in crime and commit suicide with them I get that. There are 330 million people in this country. A fraction of a percent use them for unlawful purposes(including suicide). You cant ban something for the many because of the actions of the few. This is a push from people based on fear, not people that think logically.

f1dket0,"
tl;dr: The Republican party usually nominates people who seem personable and likeable, like Baker. The Democrats usually nominate unlikeable ""career politicians"" who are skilled at aligning party forces in their favor but not at relating to the actual human beings who vote.

I trace this all back to 1990, when we had a really oddball primary election.  Bill Weld ran in the Republican primary as a socially-liberal, fiscally-conservative Republican. So, like yay for gay rights but boo for taxes. Stuff like that.

In the Democratic primary we had two fairly typical Democratic ""machine"" politicians, plus a loudmouth probably-racist boor named John Silber.

Many liberals ""crossed over"" and voted in the Republican primary that year, because Weld had fairly decent social policies, and was pretty much the only likeable person in the race on either side.  In the Democratic primary, the two ""standard issue"" Democrats split the vote, and Silber got nominated.

So, in the general election, you had a liberal Republican against a bigoted jackass Democrat.  Weld won the election as a Republican.

His record as governor was actually pretty good for a Republican. For example, I personally believe he saved the lives of quite a few of gay teenagers in the state through some of the school programs he supported (essentially saving them from suicide).

Weld resigned before the end of his term to take a plum federal position, and his lieutenant governor took over.. this was a stuffed suit named Paul Cellucci, who as far as I remember never said or did anything of note. When the next election happened, the Democrats nominated some not-particularly-likeable machine politician. Voters went with the incumbent Republican, but it was close.

Cellucci also resigned, I forget why. He was succeed by Jane Swift. In the next election, the incumbent Swift was not nominated by the Republicans. Instead, they nominated Mitt Romney. Romney ran on a platform somewhat similar to Weld. He claimed to be socially reasonable (not liberal, but reasonable) and fiscally prudent.  He claimed to have a solid record in business and in ""saving"" the SLC Olympics. The Democrats, again, nominated a machine politician that nobody really liked. And they lost again.  Not too long after being elected, Romney basically renounced all the nice things he said during the campaign and became quite conservative. Basically, he started angling for the presidency immediately after being elected.

In the next election, the Democrats won because they nominated Deval Patrick.  Patrick was a generally likeable person who was pretty good at talking with and relating to regular people. And, I think that people weren't super happy with the new super-conservative Romney, so there was no ""incumbent party advantage"" for the Republicans this time around. 

(However, note that the Democrats lost a senate race in this time period because the republicans ran a fairly personable ""everyday guy"" kinda character. While the Democrats nominated... a machine politician that nobody liked.)

That brings us to 2014. Again, the Republicans nominate a fairly likeable seemingly down-to-earth guy in Charlie Baker. And, hey guess what? The Democrats nominate *the same fucking person who needlessly pissed away a Senate seat a few years before!!*  And, of course, the Democrats lost again.",comment,Boston,1.0

dyb5o2a,"&gt;Correlation does not imply causation. For example, people who live in high crime neighborhoods or have suicidal tendencies might be more likely to own firearms. 

You would have to get an accurate number of actual defensive gun uses in the home.  Including cases where a shot isn't even fired.

The very low end of estimated defensive gun uses a year is something like 250,000.  The high end, which is actually closer to the CDC's survey data is 2.2-2.5 million per year.  The number of all shootings combined pales in comparison to those numbers.

I find it extremely hard to believe that you are more likely to accidently shoot yourself or a family member than you are to use a gun to defend your home.

The study quoted most often to ""claim"" that is the case used data collected from hospitals.  

This is flawed because in many cases a gun does not even need to be fired for an intruder to be stopped.  

Simply brandishing a gun will stop many in their tracks or cause them to flee.  How could you get an accurate number of defensive uses from hospitals when a gun isn't even fired?

 The world wide heroin epidemic is the result of the CIA and the United States invading Afghanistan. And there has never been anything like it. Ever. It is a problem that has no end, and it's incredibly depressing to realize that my government, the Pentagon, and the CIA, are making billions of dollars every year from heroin while Americans are destroying themselves and dropping like flies. I feel so sorry for heroin addicts. They are in the grip of something that is so all consuming and evil, and every time they shoot up it's like playing Russian roulette with a needle. Those people are living like pigs. It's so sad.


__Heroin Dealer in Chief. Afghanistan, Source of 90% of The World’s Heroin__

By William Edstrom Global Research, January 21, 2016


""CIA organized, trained and armed the Mujahideen (later re-named Taliban) to fight a 1979 Soviet invasion into Afghanistan and to push heroin on Russians. CIA contracted NLC trucks to send weapons through Pakistan to Afghanistan and to bring heroin back. After Soviet withdrawal, Taliban took control of Afghanistan’s government.""

 ""US government installed Hamid Karzai, CIA agent, as Afghanistan’s President in 2002 to restore the drug trade. Ahmed Wali Karzai, heroin dealer, was Hamid’s brother. “The Afghan narcotics economy was a carefully designed project of the CIA”. By 2006, LA Times reported Afghan heroin flooding in, but wouldn’t investigate how. 1,000,000 people worldwide have been killed by heroin from US-occupied Afghanistan.""

“224,000 hectares of Afghan opium can make 560,000 kilograms of heroin annually. $450/gram x 1,000 x 560,000 equals $252,000,000,000 cold hard cash annually. $252 billion annually dealing heroin could supplement CIA’s Congressional financing (or be Plan B for CIA financing).”




“2,500,000 heroin addicts plus 2,000,000 casual heroin users means 1/70 Americans use heroin. Crime waves are surging, ruining families and neighborhoods, shocking and awing victims being robbed and sometimes killed by addicts craving another piece of heroin pie from US-occupied Afghanistan.”


“In 2013, an American died every 64 minutes from heroin, now, an American dies every 32 minutes. Americans being killed at a rate of 165,000 per decade by Afghan heroin is triple the 55,000 Americans killed in the Vietnam War (1965-1975).”

haimjgi,"This is not about my social life. My career prospects and mental health have also been affected. As mentioned prior, both semesters of my study abroad have been canceled as well as a very prestigious internship on The Hill in Washington DC. Both things i worked extremely hard for and will not be able to get back or recreate. 

To be clear, I’m not advocating to be unsafe or to put people at severe risk by any stretch of the imagination. What I am advocating for is not jumping the gun and throwing the entire university back online. There are other ways to ensure safety. 

Mental health is equally as important as physical health. I don’t believe you will find many students, college or not, that have not been negatively impacted by online learning. While you are correct that it is almost criminal the University is asking full tuition, they absolutely will not decrease the price. What they are willing to work with students on, is in person classes. 

If this was my social life I was complaining about, this post would read differently. But as mentioned, I’m a senior and I have friends. If I want to go to parties I can. They happen. My argument is primarily about events (job fairs, dinners with mentors, and even formals as they are networking events) being canceled and classes. With no face to face interaction - a staple to proper mental health- the quality of students life decreases significantly. There is a reason prisons use solitary confinement as a horrendous punishment. It is mentally debilitating. I encourage you to do some research on the dramatic increase in depression and suicide amongst college students as a result of shut downs.

Am I sad that my college social life was stripped? Yes of course and I am justified in that. However, my priority concern is academics. That has been impacted the most. I have lost mentors, the opportunity to be published, internships, study abroad, and research fellowships; as have MANY others. We chose to go to UT because of all of the opportunities and success it offers. And by shutting things down prematurely, that is being yanked away from us. 

If this argument makes me immature, so be it. But I will not apologize for wanting my ACADEMIC experience to be as fruitful as possible. I will not apologize for endorsing in person classes for the mental health of all UT students. I most certainly will not apologize for being disappointed at the situation and upset at those who want to precipitately throw us back into the absolute hell we have been in the last year.

I am not a 15 year old who is complaining about not being able to go shotgun a beer on 6th street. I am an adult who has struggled mentally and physically through some of the toughest academic conditions and seen others do the same. 

I am also completely aware that life is not perfect and things don’t go as planned. I don’t need a condescending Reddit post to tell me that. However, what i can and will do is push for things to get as close to as perfect as i can get them. I would be pretty immature if I threw up my hands and said “i guess it is what it is” without trying to fix it, now wouldn’t I? 

Oh and btw. My parents along with MANY others are concerned about their children’s livelihood - and they agree with me. Remember that college kids have parents too.

kgb7oul,"As a native Chicagoan who has lived in Houston for the last 5 years - this is not an easy answer, but I think mainly boils down to 3 key points: family priorities, weather, and cost of living. 

As far as family - you are young and have plenty of time to decide if being close to family is important or if being an easy flight away is manageable. As mentioned elsewhere on this thread - many people do meet their life partners in professional schools so it is worth considering because you are more likely to end up with a partner from Chicago if you go to school in Chicago. 

As far as weather - the winters in Chicago are brutal and last for a long time. The snow ends up being annoying but not a huge deal - it's plowed very quickly and managed well by the city. It can snow anywhere between October and May. The cold sucks, but you can wear layers to deal and typically it's not too much worse than other midwest or east coast cities. Your hands and lips will be cracked and dry, your snot and eyelashes may freeze. The worst though is how gray it is. You will not get pretty, sunny cold days. In fact, you will not see the sun very often between November and May which gets really depressing. In my opinion the depression of winter in Chicago is not comparable to the brutal heat of summers in Houston (which you've already experienced living in Austin).

Finally cost of living - despite what some people have said on this thread - it is absolutely cheaper to live in Houston than Chicago. While you may not feel the difference between paying and not paying state income tax - this is a significant consideration if you have a job. Additionally, EVERYTHING is cheaper in Houston when compared to Chicago: rent prices (for similar size, location apartments), parking, ubers, food, gas, daycares, etc. 

I agree with almost everything that u/CloudsandSunsets says, but will add that both cities have good airports, beautiful parks, excellent food options, nice people. 

The things I miss about Chicago are how walkable and accessible by public transportation it is (but this is mainly a summer issue), and being by water - the Lake is beautiful.

fq8qd1l,"Tracking deaths is hard - why I posted a couple studies with different results from experts who know how to analyze it statistically. It is more complicated than I could hope to analyze as a layman so I need to look to what the experts say. But in broad strokes, we can figure out how many suicides, for example, are linked to the Great Depression because we have data on the number of suicides per year, and can look at large-scale trends by looking at how many suicides there were before 2008, the trajectory of the number of suicides per year prior to 2008, and the number of suicides after 2008 and see if they follow that trajectory or increase/decrease.


To include OD deaths, you want to look at ""deaths of despair,"" why I included another study that analyzes potential for those from coronavirus. If you look at the [chart on this page](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/2019/9/long-term-trends-in-deaths-of-despair), you'll see those were increasing before 2008, and did see a more rapid increase afterwards. But again, we can analyze how much these increase over time since we have 12 years since 2008 to look at, data on drug overdoses, and thus can get an idea of how the economic downturn affected those rates. Note also the percentage of population here is small - the scale on that chart goes from 0-50 deaths per 100,000 people. Even in the 8 years since the 2008 included there, deaths did not increase by 10 or 20 fold or any such massive number.


I have little doubt that the lockdown and economic consequences of it will have impact - but the analysis from experts suggests the effect will not be completely out of control.


We are not simply trading young lives for old - people of all ages are killed by the virus, if healthcare systems get overloaded people of all ages will die from conditions not related to the coronavirus, we know little about the virus and the long-term health effects survivors may experience (for example we are just starting to learn how it may affect children with this odd post-coronavirus syndrome observed in New York - a few have died), if too many people get infected nobody will want to leave their houses and spend money on an open economy anyway, all the people with lost loved ones will suffer emotionally, etc. To say we are trading young for old lives is a vast oversimplification.


Certainly there is plenty of room for debate on what the optimal strategy would be - nobody can say what that is especially since we are comparing things like human lives and livelihoods that are not easily given values. But it seems clear to me the optimal strategy would not be to either not lock down at all and face up to 2.2 million deaths and the economic consequences of an uncontrolled plague, nor would it be to lock everyone down for 12-18 months until there is a vaccine since the economic devastation would be immense, perhaps apocalyptic.

I'll try to keep this short and omit her history (as I know it) prior to his month. She was arrested by police in another city and hospitalized for 72 hours, but all you need to do to get out of that is (a) tell them you aren't going to kill yourself, and (maybe b) not have insurance. 

She phoned other family members to tell them when she's discharged from the hospital, she'd disappear, and we'd never find her body. I was able to pick her up and bring her home with me.

One of the advantages of having a home is that you have a system for getting rid of your waste (toilets for your shit, trash cans for your other stuff) all within good proximity. People generally tend to trash things when they don't have reasonably quick access to them like when they're at theme parks and open areas. When you're an addict or down on your luck, things like that aren't your top priority and wishing people could just ""do their crack/heroin or be depressed/retarded in a cleanly manner"" isn't a reasonable expectation.

You also can't just ship them away on a bus, that makes it someone else's problem. I think the best way to tackle the problem would be to remove the drugs and integrate them back into society in an environment where they're treated as people ( I've been to hospitals, which mostly stabilize you, charge you, then kick you out for the next batch of people. I've never experienced rehab. ). It's harder to garner support for those types of programs because they're expensive in both time and money and the economic potential of homeless people isn't sexy politics.

So the fact that the entire state spends 250,000 (seems pretty cheap to me, ought to be more) cleaning up areas seems like an easily marketable middle ground solution to the problem for regularly contributing citizens to me.

Then again, you could just shoot them all. It's not humane, but it's probably a cheaper solution.

The main crux of it is that, because sometimes police need to be violent, they are given carte blanche to apply that violence in every situation evenly regardless of if the situation actually calls for it, when in reality police will only need guns and applied violence a very small fraction of the time.

I also feel that my admission here is honestly a fluke. I also don't even like what I'm studying, and I feel like school is becoming more of a chore rather than enjoyment. I go to every single class, study regularly, and I still have been struggling to adjust to the classes here. Every time I walk past people happy here I shudder and feel unwelcomed knowing that I can't do that or have a valid interaction with people without making things awkward. I have no friends to fall back to and I feel like more of a burden to people when I ask for help. 

The thing that stresses me out the most is that I'm really trying to internally transfer into computational/aerospace engineering but I'm currently in my third year of college (used to be an engineering major at ACC, decided it wasn't for me, but now I want to pursue it again) so I've been regretting everything since coming here. My GPA is also probably too low (failed the first two exams in M 427L, so I can only get like a 3.43 in residence GPA at best assuming I can bounce back on the final). I've also been going crazy and secretly condemn myself and struggle to pick up hobbies. 

I want to transfer to a different university for engineering, but money is tight and I would be set far behind everyone else. I feel like I've ruined my whole college experience and shattered my dreams. One other option I could do is tailor the math degree, but it's just not the same as engineering.

j9jl293,"I'm not trying to be an asshole but this is woefully misinformed so please read and then go to the county and state assessor web page. Illinois assessment law has been relatively unchanged for some time. The way the process works is quite simple and varies in it's implementation depending on the township or city and their manpower but it all follows the same state law. 

You property VALUE is determined by a 3 year rolling average of comparable sales. That's the basic explanation. So if the market is depressed then your home can be sold for less and so the assessment goes down. If the market (the amount home buyers are paying) goes crazy like now then your assessment increases in turn. 

The way this is implemented in reality is that the city employs an assessor and deputy assessor's. Their job is to take all the sales data that is submitted every time a home is sold and create a value for every home and business. It's a very daunting task so they clearly don't individually assess each home. They do what is referred to as batch assessment. If they have a neighborhood that is all similar construction or done by the same builder they batch assess that neighborhood. This means every parcel of land is given the same value and every house if they are all cookie cutter will have the exact same value and that is driven off home sales in a 3 year period prior to the tax year. 

So my home I purchased for say 150,000 thousand. The assessor uses the sales in my neighborhood and there are 5 homes similar to mine that sold in the years 2019-2021 they take the home sale price and average them out and apply that new average to my homes value. After they have a fair market value they add a multiplayer of .3333 which is in state law. So my homes assessed value when I purchased it was 49,995. If the fair market value we're to increase to say 210,000, my new assessment will be 69,993. The assessor passes of that value to the tax office who then applies the tax rate to your homes value and sends out a tax bill. 




Holy shit that sounds complicated but it's crazy simply especially for you the homeowner to appeal. I appeal my assessment almost every year. It's in the city's best interest to use the highest sale values for it's averages to inflate valuation and thus tax incomes. It's in the homeowners best interest to find 3 homes with LOW comparable sale values to derive that equalized assessment value. So every time a home in your neighborhood is sold for more than you paid, just look at your tax burden increasing due to the fair market saying your home is worth more. 

I have been appealing by myself without and attorney successfully for over 8 years now. This year is my first time taking my appeal to PTAB which is Illinois property tax appeal board. And after speaking with my township assessor he expects them to find in my favor. Remember the assessor is not your enemy and kindness towards them results in much help in your appeals. There are some key points in neglected to include here such as county multiplayers for townships etc but the core of the information is included.

Cook county has slightly different rules to the state but the appeal process is detailed out on their web page they use a 10 percent valuation model. It's all irrelevant if you appeal with the state because then state rules apply I believe. But on that I could be mistaken as I live outside cook now.

It would be too easy to entertain conspiracy theories around BBBY/GME etc... and I'd much rather wait and see what comes out. Furthermore, this happened a lot in 2008 when the market crashed. We're experiencing some eerily similar times so it could be similar. Lastly, it's just possible he was dealing with some things that are completely unrelated so I still want to leave this post with condolences for the family - mother and 2 daughters - he left behind. 

People in finance often have connections to entities involved in some shady dealings. I've already seen multiple people source some of Gustavo's circle back to BCG or Emigrant.

lb6iox9,"Look, I haven't run any studies but I'm highly skeptical that replacing a word with another word of the same meaning without any change in context would result in change.

A racial slur has a different meaning and context than another vernacular term that refers to the same racial group.

Using a phrase in place of a specific word (ie to replace 'suicide' with 'took their own life') goes from specific (associated with a specific trauma) to slightly more indirect (change one word and the phrase has an entirely different meaning)

But to replace kill with unalive doesn't accomplish either of those tasks. On the contrary, if there was a scale of potential traumatic associations, I would argue unalive his a higher potential. It originated as a way to talk about suicide on tiktok (to my understanding), while kill is more broad.

lyvg8ia,"I have found this mind-boggling for quite some time now.

We live in a spacious $1,500 1-bd rent-stabilized apt near mid-city. It's a wonderful place, one of these historic art deco living spaces we lucked into a long time ago. It never made sense to move or buy in L.A. and in the past we chose to stay put. Our closet space alone is mind-boggling. Now tho? We're completely priced out of home buying anywhere near where we live, and we couldn't move to another rental of comparable size and quality in this area if we wanted to. It would double our rent, at a minimum. Yes, we've been lucky. But we're also trapped in this place now if we want to stay here. That's a common predicament in L.A. these days.

Meanwhile, a 2-bdr single family home down the street was sold, renovated inside and out and has since been sitting empty for almost two years. Two whole years. Occasionally the corporate owners make a half-assed attempt to hold an open house every few months to which almost nobody shows up. 

Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that the owners converted the 2-car detached garage on the property into an ADU. Now the property has no parking in a neighborhood where street parking is very scarce. It may also have something to do with the property's back yard running right up to the playground of a school. The master bedroom's beautiful wide French doors open onto.... a playground 30 feet away. A fact that the listing obscures with aggressively skillful deception. Not that anyone with eyes can't see it the second they visit the property. The kicker? There used to be a wall there, and a much smaller door to a deck. The corporate owners put in the master bedroom French doors that open onto a noisy playground. For the love of Cthulu, why?

List price for that property? $2.4 million. I've been in the house and it's nothing special. There are no hidden gems or breath-taking historic features inside. It's nice, roomy with hardwood floors, good lighting and no AC. Like a lot of old houses in L.A. It's like they don't want to sell the property.

The typical mortgage payment is listed as $15,000. Ten times our rent. I mean sure, it's a whole house but what even is this absurdity? You're not selling a ginormous pile of magical self-replicating gold bars. You're selling a mid 100-yr old house in an unfortunate location with no garage, no parking and a tiny yard.

Absolutely nothing about that property makes it worth multiple millions. It's ludicrous. And that's just one example.

We're thinking about leaving L.A., the dystopian nightmare vibe is getting stronger and it long ago stopped being fun. The rent on our place will double or triple when we move out. Nobody else who comes after us will be able to enjoy living here at a reasonable price like we could for so long. That's a depressing thought and it does make me wonder where this will all end. 

Will L.A. become a truly dystopian place where only the very wealthy can afford to live well, with an ever growing homeless population and sprawling slums that house the poor and destitute, the permanent underclass? We're reluctantly choosing to leave because it's soul-crushing to live in a place that seems to be heading that way.

h40df2q,"&gt;This digs into the deeper problem where our politics are too easily corrupted by money and special interests.

Hence why I want to give LESS control over money to politics.

&gt;I'm not sure what this has anything to do with taking care of basic needs in a society. But I'd assume that's how our ruling class feels.

And you, too, apparently.

&gt;IT's a list of standards that are widely used today. I'd think that you'd weigh them all equally. Generally, the higher teacher to student ratio, the better. Do you have an example where it's not the case? And since we're talking about the university system. I'd think that you'd want to make sure the student to teacher ratio should be consistent across all of their classes. This principal should also apply for primary education as it's not a hard standard to measure.

You can't ""weigh them all equally"" unless they are all measured the same way (they aren't). For example, what class size is of equal weight to a student:teacher ratio of 20? And, again, I'm not asking about whether the standards are widely used, or what most people think. I'm asking about YOUR proposal. Yes, I can easily give an example where a higher teacher to student ratio isn't necessarily better; imagine 30 teachers for every student. Why would you imagine that the same ratio is appropriate across all disciplines in a grade? Do you really think that the same ratio is optimal in, say, a history lecture and a hands-on chemistry lab?

&gt;That's a different question. Income inequality is generally bad for a consumer economy, but sure lets switch the topic to why you should care about income inequality. So lets focus in on the context of a developed nation like America where it's the most relevant to the two of us. So the effects of income inequality includes higher rates of health and social problems, and lower rates of social goods, a lower population-wide satisfaction and happiness and even a lower level of economic growth when human capital is neglected for high-end consumption.

Income inequality is not the same as neglecting human capital in the service of high-end consumption. I reject entirely the idea that income inequality fundamentally leads to things like more health problems. Does it perhaps lead to lower happiness? Possibly, but that's just as much a problem of mindset as anything else. It doesn't affect my happiness, because I don't care how rich the richest people are. I care about the poorest people, and I don't limit my concern to my countrymen (though you may, if you like).

&gt;So lets take a look at the issue that brought up the reddit post to begin with. You see economic growth hampered by the labor shortage caused by poor incentives and a labor force that has moved on during the pandemic. You see increased crime and suicide rates in our poorest of communities and the crime sometimes spills over to the wealthier parts as well. Now we are very careful to keep our income inequality slightly below the other nations, otherwise we'd see a trend of human capital flight. But what we're starting to see recently is that people are moving out of expensive metros in favor of the less expensive ones. Now you start to see labor shortages in the expensive metros and the cycle will continue.

We're ""very careful"" to keep our income inequality slightly below other nations? As measured how?

&gt;But why should you care? I don't know where you fit on the scale. Presumably you're doing well for yourself if you're still living in boston. The average rent is around 3k a month to be comfortable. So I'd assume that you'd be okay until the rent gets pushed up to the point where you're the next one to be squeezed out. But if you're part of the class of people who has over 10 million in net worth, then you probably don't have much to worry about unless you're invested in the local economy to some extent. Without consumers or a labor force, you'll see something very similar to what happenned in Vancouver.

I don't have much to worry about because I am adaptable. I'm not tied to Boston; I work here, but could as easily work a dozen other places within a few weeks.

&gt;No, if the charter school had to take everyone similar to public schools, they can be compared accurately.

And many of them do.

&gt;I usually accept published scientific studies. But the closest one that I've found so far was the DOE one. https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/choice/pcsp-final/execsum.html

&gt;I'm sure there's more to study. But I can only hope that we as a country that trends towards increasing access to education. BUt anything that involves private sector usually trends towards the opposite of improved public access.

Again, that's absurd. You might as well claim that the existence of FedEx and UPS have made it more difficult or expensive to ship goods.

&gt;There's an accelerated process for the big players in town. It's incredibly fast. Most drugs go through this process.

&gt;https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/04/21/64-of-FDA-approved-meds-pass-through-streamlined-processes/9821587475020/

The moderna vaccine was ready for trial before the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the US. How fast was that process? Did the FDA review the data on a rolling basis? How long after they received the trial data did they even BEGIN their review?

&gt;Like I said, most drugs are fast tracked. But generally, you'd want to make sure that our food and drugs are safe and not going to give us some sort of long term poisoning. There's already toxic products that gets approved, think of all the crap that was likely rejected. Again you don't want to end up like China where no consumer in your country trusts anything that your country makes. I think patents are the bigger issue because decades ago I never thought that a cheap drug would be more expensive per ounce than cobra venom decades later.

Yes, you said most drugs are fast tracked. If that were true, maybe it would mean something. The problem with the FDA is that they are not legally mandated to merely certify safety, but efficacy. That's a far more onerous process that has nothing to do with your complaints about ""toxic products"".

&gt;I'd call it taking away the safeguards that was intended to avoid another depression.

&gt;You have to create regulations to keep up with the constantly advancing society. It would be a problem to expect that society would never change and thus regulations do not need to be updated.

It would be a bigger problem if people could somehow look back on decades of regulations that failed entirely to accomplish their goals, and indeed often had the opposite effect, and somehow were blind enough to say ""Well, now, I'm sure some more regulations will fix this!""

&gt;Yes and there's also a lot of misinformation as well. But I do agree that it's easier to learn the basics than ever. Hopefully this doesn't change in the next few decades.

It's not just easier to learn ""the basics"". You can learn about calculus, astrophysics, nuclear power plant design, all sorts of things. For free.

&gt;That stuff was done by the subcontractors. So you could include the big dig in that list. Do you mean the mckinsey consultants that didn't build a single track in california? If you're talking about major infrastructure projects that was run end to end by private, I don't think they exist. The private sector does not have a vested interest in massive infrastructure like roads and rails that connects a nation. After all, nothing is a better investment than a stock buyback.

Yes, it was done by subcontractors....chosen, hired, and directed by the public. If you want to claim that private investors have no vested interest in massive infrastructure like road and rail that connect a nation...I strongly suggest you look into the history of infrastructure. Just as one example among many, you could look into Cornelius Vanderbilt (who, incidentally, provided the initial endowment that founded Vanderbilt University, a very successful private research university). Even today, a lot of crucial infrastructure is privately built and owned.

&gt;There's no regulation or dergulation that can defeat the ""market value"" of housing. So long as private equity continue to buy up all inventory before anyone else. You'll only see housing go up in prices along with the number of empty homes. If we don't do something about vacant homes, you'll end up with zombie cities like in china. Oh and let me tell you about the absence of regulation over there.

Please, do tell me about the ""absence of regulation"" in China. I can use a large pile of horseshit for the rose bushes around here. And talking about regulation or deregulation ""defeating"" the market value of housing is pointless. You might as well argue whether blue is larger than nine. The market value is not ""defeated"" by anything. It is changed and distorted by many things.

&gt;I think that we need to kick the criminals out of our government. Because right now it's a public private revolving door. Personally, I'd like to replace them all with AI.

Suicide? Come on…really? If we’re arguing about acts of violence, we need to be specific on whether acts of violence against oneself has the same weight as violence against other people. 

While suicide does have long lasting repercussions for the family and friends involved, it is not even remotely the same as someone shooting a cashier during a robbery or killing a rival gang member. 

Plus, while not the right thread for whether suicide is right or wrong, I will say that I will never judge anyone who has decided to take their own life with whatever method they chose. 

As a firearms owner, Does it piss me off they used a gun? Sure but that quickly gets erased when I weigh my anger against their pain and choice to end their life.

They’re not. Guns are largely ineffective at killing people. As a whole, most people shot will survive being shot and shot placement is everything. Aren’t there millions of people who always cry “Why don’t the police just shoot them in the leg, arm, whatever”?

Special status? That pesky Constitution. I mean really….

m03oi8t,"The most heartbreaking part to me, is people will just keep going wild with conspiracies and romanticizations of the case. In my opinion, she is  clearly in psychosis. My brother is bipolar and had a drug induced psychosis back in 2020. He all of a sudden thought my entire family was evil, we were feeding him glass, thought Donald Trump was calling him to be his vice president, and tried to get on a plane to Tahiti. Luckily, my mom might be a hellicopter mom, but she did her research right away, deduced he was in psychosis, got conservatorship, and put him in a very expensive and safe psych ward that luckily my parents could afford (200k for 6 months) and offer the best treatment. He didn’t get out of psychosis until 3 months later, only with heavy antipsychotics, and he still doesn’t remember anything about what he did during those months. He was officially diagnosed with bipolar, where we found out he was more predisposed to psychosis already, and the drugs just set him off. Hopefully Hannah is found, can recover from whatever she’s going through, and can get the help/treatment she needs (as mental health issues seem to run in the family with her fathers recent suicide).

I agree the girl was lonely, wanted desperately to fit in, and exhibited a lot of attention-seeking behavior.

I’m sure the anti-depressant drugs she was on weren’t helping her at all.

As for Conrad...that kid was sadly really messed up. The texts they showed between them  indicated he was really abusive and manipulative of her at times. I’m not convinced he wouldn’t have committed suicide without her influence. Like you said, he had tried a number of times before.

lf5hyim,"Yeah. I’ll try and respond and post it tomorrow it’s delicious but pretty basic.  Grandma did switch to box matzo ball mixes (preferred manischewitz but streits is fine) she did an experiment and compared hers to the box mixes and since she didn’t use schmaltz in the balls there wasn’t really a difference.  So why not go with what’s easy?  We’d often add garlic to the balls. 

Also still without looking at recipe,  she’d happily use store bought broth as a time saver (already some flavor) and then add more veggies, chicken, seasonings to it and let that simmer for a very long time. If needed add more broth always buy twice the number of things of broth that you think you need.  Also cook planning on leftovers.  Put a parsnip and any other seasonings you want flavor from but don’t want chunks of in your soup (bones, bay leaves, be creative within reason) in a cheese cloth and tie that bundle up tightly so it can add a lot of flavor but not make you need to pick things out.   I have no idea why the parsnip only added flavor maybe she or one of her kids really didn’t like it except as a flavor enhancement… actually now that I think about it I bet in leaner days (like when she grew up during the Great Depression) the parsnip then went on the Seder plate but she’s not here to ask if there was a reason and I don’t remember questioning it, she also taught me when I was a kid and likely the bay leaf and the parsnip appeared together so until I was older I thought both added flavor but you can’t eat them? Who knows!) so parsnip in cheesecloth in the soup but optional to just have parsnip in with carrots, celery, onion.   Have as much chicken as you’d like.  

If making it vegetarian no chicken or bones, do all the same things but use vegetarian broth double the amounts of seasonings you would use and get a decent white wine that’s good for drinking or for cooking with and the whole bottle goes in.  Broth should simmer long enough to cook out most or all of the alcohol.  You can also add more veggies based on what you like, same is true for chicken soup on the veggies. 

Optional boil the matzo balls in a separate pot with broth.  That broth then could be added to soup to make sure there’s more broth for leftovers.  Box mix says in water (also separate pot).  

Really it’s not that difficult to make a good soup, time and tasting often enough to make sure it’s not missing a seasoning or some salt or something else, is what most people miss out on and then wonder why their broth is more bland.",comment,LosAngeles,0.0

Look, we've all been down on our luck at one point or another.  I couldn't imagine not having a roof over my head and money in the bank.  The homeless people whom I feel the sorriest for are those who are genuinely mentally ill through no fault of their own (i.e. schizophrenia, severe depression, bipolar disorder, etc.).

But, with all due respect, the homeless problem has gotten so out of hand that it's becoming unsafe, as exemplified by your experience, and even a public health hazard.  It's to the point that, in certain places in SF, there's a stench in the air of feces and urine.  It's disgusting.

Why is nothing done?  Why is no progress made to solve this problem?  Because according to a certain set of people, we're supposed to feel so sorry for them and, because this set of people has so much power and influence in SF, the police and DA don't do anything.  If they do, they'll be seen as evil and heartless.  According to these people, if a homeless person is openly pissing or shitting in public, well....what's s/he supposed to do?  Those poor homeless don't have access to a public bathroom, you evil techie/transplant/yuppie!!!!!!!.

Even worse, are the ""homeless"" gypsies all over the Bay Area who panhandle with kids pretending to be down on their luck, and then they usually get picked up by someone in a fancy car.  Those people are SCAMMING you.  They're not genuinely poor.  They're not genuinely downtrodden.  I suspect they're part of a big group of people where there's a head honcho who tells certain gypsies go to certain places on certain days for certain durations.  I also suspect that there's human/child trafficking involved.

I'm all for being compassionate, but the homeless situation in SF has been out of hand for years and isn't getting any better.  If it were left up to me, I'd go full Rudy Giuliani and take swift action to solve the problem.

edti8m2,"All of these are just arbitrary restrictions on our **rights** (these are not privileges). They also would likely be ineffective (these aren't backed by any data), some would be completely unenforceable, and they set the stage for further encroachment of our rights moving forward because they set dangerous precedent.

1. Arbitrary restriction of ammunition that also invalidates the keeping and bearing of arms. Doubt it would be anything but overturned in the courts. Also would be completely ineffective - can just go over to WA to buy ammo. Also not particularly enforceable. How would you audit this? Would you ask police to go door-to-door to search people's homes for ammunition? Opens up for further restriction - maybe it goes down to 10 next year, and 5 after that, and then to 0? The precedent for restricting this would allow it. 

2. Magazine bans are ineffective and have proven to be so. For example in other states, companies just take a 30 round (standard capacity) AR mag and convert the loading mechanism to hold 10. People just convert the magazine back to 30 rounds. Also, several shootings have taken place with restricted capacity magazines; the VA Tech shooter being the most notorious. He used 10 round magazines, and just carried a lot more of them. Again, not particularly enforceable - how would you determine if people had disposed of their 30 round mags? Would every gun owner at a range be searched and inspected to make sure their magazines only held 5 rounds?

3. Arbitrary restriction on how much you can exercise a right. Unfortunately this has been enacted in several states, but has been used to essentially start registries (states have to maintain these records, so they know who owns guns). Besides, most shooters just steal their weapons from people who purchased them legally. 

4. This won't do anything effective. We already have a universal background check law in Oregon (which is not effective per state background check data), so why double it? Again, what about ammo brought in from other states? 

5. How would you enforce this? Mandatory searches? These laws only punish people after the fact; they don't incentivize people to actually follow these laws. 

6. This absolutely violates the 2nd Amendment. A single individual deciding whether or not a citizen is allowed to *have their right at all* turns our rights into privileges. Does not go through due process to restrict a citizen's rights.

7. Safety courses aren't a bad thing (I believe people should take one), but you can't set conditions on a right. You either have it or you don't.

8. Age restriction on rights invalidates the right. Plus, doesn't stop shootings - plenty of shooters have gotten their hands on weapons while under this age, by stealing them from people who purchased them legally. 

9. Poll tax. You can't tax someone's ability to exercise their right. This is blatantly unconstitutional.

I think the reason you believe these restrictions to be reasonable is because you don't view the 2nd Amendment as a right. I personally find that unfortunate, because it is the most important right that we have; it's figuratively and literally the ""right hand man"" to the 1st Amendment. I believe that we have a violence issue in our country, but restricting our rights is a poorly thought out band-aid solution that will work out poorly for citizens in the long term. There are many known causes of this violence that for some reason a lot of people want to completely ignore - income inequality, mental health (specifically those like depression and pertaining to suicide, one of the leading causes if not the leading cause of deaths by guns), and social disparity and intolerance among regions of our country (which also play into issues like income inequality).

izm7crv,"There is no way to defend BDB. His actions directly led to the preventable deaths of thousands of people.

Remember NYC wasn’t the worst city in the country. It wasn’t the worst outbreak in North America. It wasn’t even just the biggest outbreak in developed countries. It was the worst *in the world* and not by any small margin - no other city, many of them much more crowded with larger numbers of people using public transit and much lower hospital capacity - came even close to what happened in NYC. Our case levels were stratospheric. 

BDB should be in prison. He wasn’t just incompetent. He lied, repeatedly, over and over and over. He lied about masks claiming they wouldn’t work. He lied about schools claiming children couldn’t spread the virus even after thousands of teachers were already sick.He lied about the risk of keeping businesses open. He lied about the risks of attending mass events and protests. He lied about providing emergency aid to hospitals. 

Then he lied about how bad things were. He lied about how bad it was in hospitals. He lied about it not affecting young people. Repeatedly.

I say “lie” bc it wasn’t him being inaccurate or ignorant or misinformed. He knew things were dangerous and said they weren’t. He knew keeping the schools open was extremely risky but thought he would lose popularity by closing them, even when so many staff were sick that most chose to stop working rather than risk death. Science officials were begging him to close things. Education officials were begging him to close the schools. The state government had to put the first large testing facility in Westchester bc he wouldn’t allow one in the city (bc he knew what it would show). He actively prevented aid from the federal gov, state gov, healthcare experts, and charities from getting to sick people and hospitals. He did nothing to get extra healthcare resources.

Never once did he accurately convey the science. He has never (and will never) take any responsibility, bc he never cared about NYC or being mayor. He just needed a springboard for a presidential run and knew he couldn’t defeat Cuomo, bc he had no experience and no qualifications and no charisma.

I was a nursing student during Covid. I will never forget what I saw. It was like a portal to hell opened up. I couldn’t believe I was still in the USA. Nurses were going in with garbage and sandwich bags as PPE. Not that there wasn’t just enough biohazard gear - there wasn’t *anything*. No surgical masks, no 95s, no goggles or face shields, no gowns, no infection control procedures, no ventilators, absences of basic medications - there was a shortage of everything. Nurses were dying left and right. Then the doctors started dying too. People were re-using PPE for weeks. Nobody went home to their families if they had anyplace else to stay - we all knew we would get sick. 

I’d say I’m proud that I didn’t run away but really I was too shocked and scared to even think about it. I just did what I was told, like most healthcare workers. I should have left - in retrospect I was at insane risk and had basically no ability to help people. Not that people wanted help anyways. They didn’t want to wear masks. They didn’t want to be tested for Covid. And god forbid De Blasio require those things - I mean, what if he lost voters? That would be the real horror. 

The city’s inaction allowed people to act like monsters. My hospital’s director committed suicide a few weeks into the peak pandemic - I’m sure many others wanted to. The trauma that healthcare professionals faced was devastating and most still can’t talk about it. It’s like being exposed to a radiation by your government. 

Biggest modeling study found that if he closed schools two weeks earlier (when the CDC and city health recommended, there were tens of thousands of cases, and most large cities had shut schools down) there would have been 500,000 fewer cases in the first wave and probably more 15,000 fewer deaths. 

Even a week earlier (when he was the only person who wanted them to stay open and his advisors could not even understand his thought process) would have led to 300,000 fewer cases and almost 10,000 fewer deaths. Then think of how many fewer deaths if he had required patients to wear masks, or provided testing services, or given healthcare providers PPE. I will never forgive that man. He’s evil. The fact that he can live with himself shows that he has absolutely zero moral compass. The city won’t recover from what he did in our lifetimes.

Oh yeah and before that his wife stole like $30 million dollars intended to go to mental health clinics for the homeless. The money has never been found, probably bc it’s in the Cayman Islands or Cyprus or Switzerland. Nice little nest egg for their retirement.

Comparing him to Adams is insane. Adams has some corrupt friends and has proposed some controversial policies. De Blasio lied his ass off while the city burned around him and then tried to run for President and created a fake mental health initiative so that his wife could steal millions from a program meant for free mental health clinics - I guess she was tired of doing nothing and needed some work to keep her busy and supplement what he felt was unfair compensation for his job. I’m not being hyperbolic when I say he should be in prison. His wife should be as well. 

Thousands of people and hundreds of businesses would still exist if he had not been a pathological liar whose only concern was his own popularity. I don’t see how Adams (or anyone) could possibly do a worse job. He is easily the worst mayor of any city in American history and was far more corrupt than Adams. But bc he’s a liberal Democrat and his wife is Black, he’ll never face any consequences and somehow is still seen as a decent guy.",comment,NYC,1.0

Diabetes, heart disease, obesity, previously had cancer, I believe those are the top four. These are also the same people who would be at risk from serious problems from contracting the normal seasonal flu.

The slower we move the more Americans who face eviction. The slower we move the more Americans we lose to depression and drug overdoses. The slower we move the more businesses fail which may never return. The slower we move the more GOOD jobs vanish which will then be replaced with low wage jobs at Wal-Mart, Amazon and similar as those mega-corporations expand to fill the void left by the small businesses who are failing. The slower we move the more damage is done to children who cannot socialize and develop normally due to restrictions at school, in sports and in normal social activities.

* Tell him to grab a buddy and take a tour of the brewery's in Seattle.

* Tell him to drive up to Vancouver and get baked out of his mind

I actually literally did do that. You could re-read the last paragraph, if you want.

&gt; While BLM doesn't have a single leadership, Trevor Noah is the most influential black and BLM supporter; he justified looting and garnered a lot of support.

I have no idea how to even express how stupid this is. ""Trevor Noah is the de facto voice of blackness and the Black Lives Matter movement and he made everyone like looting"" is r/conspiracy level dumbfuckery. You are too online if you think that's what the world is like. Go outside. Maybe, if you dare, talk to some black people.

&gt; Even you don't condemn looting.

Looting is indeed one of the many things I failed to condemn in my post. I also didn't condemn suicide bombing or forced female circumcision. This is because what I wasn't writing about the morality of any of these things. I was responding to certain specific aspects of your ridiculous post.

Oh, by the way. Most of the looting that occurred in St. Louis happened in the neighborhood where I live. Windows on my street were boarded up for months, and some of the small businesses affected never came back. Fuck looters, fuck looting, and fuck you and your dumbshit assumptions.

&gt; Even you don't condemn looting. Therefore, evidently, a lot of BLM supporters support looting.

I know I already quoted the first sentence here, but seriously, writing these two sentences right in a row is an embarrassment to the concepts of logic and literacy.

&gt; If you didn't, you would have criticized it like I did.

The reason I didn't criticize it is because a) I was focused on talking about how dumb your comment was, and b) *the fact that looting is bad is fundamentally uncontroversial.* Some extremist anti-corporation weirdos will say looting a Target is good or whatever, but basically everyone thinks looting sucks.

No he won't.  He will die some day 15-20 years from now, in a paranoid psychosis, detached from reality, with the thoughts of how he fucked up his life running through his head.  He won't remember what happiness is at that point.    

I was originally pro-life in prison, but upon further reflection, I've come to the determination that death is the best of both worlds,  At least with life, he knows that he always has tomorrow to wake up, go about his day (or whatever modicum of a day he might have) until he eventually dies of old age or suicide.  Being on death row, he knows the end is near.  He will have nightmares for the rest of his life, knowing what is just around that corner.  He will be severely traumatized, just as he traumatized all of us on that one day.

ei31lag,"FWIW, 70% of all guns used in violent crime are stolen or straw purchased, and thus illegally obtained. So, legal owners are not the issue there. This country has over 300 *million* guns in circulation, but we only average 11,000 homicides per year, including police justified honicides. Of those 11,000, the FBI’s own stats say approximately 69-72% are gang on gang violence. 

So, something like 3,000-3,500 murders per year, by firearm, happen in non gang-on-gang violence. The vast majority of the remaining homicides are going to be familial relations killing a family member. Only about 5% of all homicides are truly random killings. (Its essentially 70% gang, 25% family, 5% insane people). 

So, with all of that information broken down, I would say that guns are not the overarching issue, societal inequality driving gang violence is. People needing family help / conseling could also help reduce those numbers. 

Here’s the big one though, you are no doubt going “11,000? But there are 33,000 gun deaths per year!” and that is true. But 22,000 of those are *suicide*, and 80% of those 22,000 are males committing suicide. So mental health, community support, care to help people get back on their feet, find a home and a new job, be able to leave a bad situation, all kinds of solutions will help is address the issues driving the so-called “gun violence epidemic”, because there are a couple of core issues driving it. The one thing that won’t fix shit though is saying we are safer without guns. Criminals will still illegally get them, and people will still find other methods to commit suicide. 

So, instead of trying to change the tool and criminalize guns by passing duplicate laws, let’s address the core issues causing these problems. ",comment,Seattle,1.0

ef6udnk,"Where else are they going to go?  I found myself homeless a little over a year ago through a situation I have written about extensively on Reddit in the past that was of no fault of my own.  What I discovered in that time through my experiences were shocking and utterly terrifying.  

I, fortunately, do not have a substance abuse issue, and besides depression and PTSD (now largelt from these experiences) are not on the spectrum of mental illnesses one usually thinks of when describing the homeless.  

This, however, hurt me more than helped me at times.  While seeking shelter at the various homeless centers I was basically interrogated  everytime, judged for not being damaged enough, and turned away often and left to wander and sleep on the street for days at a time.  Once I got into a shelter, I was immediately attacked twice, once from a man wanting my backpack of clothes and my laptop (I'm still an enrolled college student and continued to try to keep up in class), and another time I believe my attacker wanted to rape me.  A vet who had been in the system for a while warned me that this is why many do not use shelters as they are very unsafe at times, it's hard to get in, and hard to stay.  Streets are safer, but you can get arrested so your best bet is a tent off to the side of the highway as to not be bothered by most anyone.  

I got lucky and found stable shelter, have stayed in class and am now in honors, but the things I saw haunted me, more than anything how inhuman I felt.  I was ignored, treated like trash, and had no recourse if anything happened to me.  I became a non-person with virtually no rights and nowhere to belong.

So where are these people going to go?  They are already been pushed out of society that far, will you move them into the woods?",comment,Atlanta,1.0
dj8sua0,"Pro Tip for OP and anyone else with a controversial post like this:

Dobt point out the dog breed and don't point out the humans gender. 


Now to my opinion: Dogs are happy with much less than we think, they live in the moment and don't ponder on how their life could be better if this or that. Although, IMO I don't believe it should be chained up in the backyard it's whole life. If you are gonna walk your dog.. Keep it on a leash. It's much much safer that way. Your dog would be happy to walk with you on a leash and it already has it better than most dogs. If your dog is aggressive then keep it away from other dogs. Play with it at home or in your backyard. Take it to training school if you really want it's behavior to change. 

Your dog will not get depressed because it's on a leash or wonder why you don't take it around other dogs. As long as you give it love and attention it will setter for that. Dogs are much less complicated than us humans. That's why so many of us are anxious  and depresses lol 

The End 

Edit: And this is just my opinion to make it less likely for  your dog to get attacked, attacking, lost or ran over. Doesn't matter what breed it is. And I'm not saying anything is guaranteed to happen if let loose. But i dont see how you can say it would be less likely if a dog is leashed. ",comment,Austin,0.0
isquzzh,"You pre-judge her as psychotic by calling her cr---. 

Do you call women the B---- word and gays the F-- word? 

If she has an objective medical disorder, psychosis, why not use medical language rather than dehumanizing slurs? 

Tumors and most objective medical diagnosis cannot be faked unless the objective medical test is somehow falsified. 

Insanity and mental illness can be faked because those are diagnosed by observing behavior and listening to words. It only requires convincing acting to fake insanity. There are a number of examples of this in the book Insanity: The Idea and Its Consequences (available via the local Portland State University library).

Tumors and diseases in pathology text books can often be diagnosed during autopsy. Mental illness cannot be diagnosed via autopsy, except if one makes the indirect inference via a bloody suicide, for example. Even then, mental illness is a subjective label which would be medicalizing suicide during autopsy, rather than viewing suicide as a moral action and deeply personal decision one decides regarding what to do with their own body. 

These are important distinctions - that insanity can be faked with good acting, but tumors and most objective bodily disease cannot. Oregon State Hospital should be shutdown except for those that want to voluntary be there non-coercively. 

Of course, in theory, one can intentionally cause in their body an actual cancer via intentional radiation exposure, but that is different than faking insanity, like the book at the Portland State University library has actual examples of.

g1p2a,"IAMa senior in high school whose mom is getting laid off from a Seattle school at the end of the school year Hey guys, I just thought I would vent So I'm a senior this year, probably going to University of Washington. My family moved to Seattle like this summer, so yeah the summer right before my senior year, which has not been fun. Any who, it has always been my parents dream to move to Seattle, which is where they grew up. So my dad got a job here last March and he moved here then me and my mom moved this summer. She is a special ed teacher and she comes into her new job with literally 0 curriculum, 0 computers for students and 0 books. Two weeks ago she got a notice saying that at the end of the year she would be losing her job due to lack of budget. Her boss said it was a mistake and that she would still have her job. Then she found out it wasn't a mistake that she would for sure lose her job but she might be able to get it back and just today she found out she was going to lose her job and would not be able to get it back. Since she's new this year she was first up to the chopping block. Now she's really depressed and I don't know what to do. My dad has to pay for my college because my older brother ruined my parent's credit so I won't be able to get student loans, well that's what my dad said. My mom is actually has to pay some of his student loan back right now because she cosigned it. I just feel so uneasy because like a month ago my dad wasn't sure if his bank where he works was going to be able to get capital and if he was going to lose his job too. His job is safe now, but my mom is for sure losing her job. It's really frustrating because of this economy is so bad, I can't find a job anywhere, and I've been applying everywhere. I don't have any work experience which puts me at a disadvantage going up against other applicants. When my sister was my age (10 years ago) she worked through high school and was able to attend an out of state college (University of Washington, we lived in Oregon) and end up only paying out of state tuition for one quarter. Also back then my mom would always say how she would always have a job. My mom is so depressed right now. I bet she's depressed for several reasons, not just losing her job. I mean I know she, like every redditor, was absolutely devastated with the unions in Wisconsin. Just the fact that our country puts our military in front of our education is crazy. I don't know. I was really upset about the Rhode Island teachers too, and that of course was a bigger travesty (good thing they aren't going to be laid off), but I guess it makes our countries issues so much more personal and put into perspective.

I believe what we're seeing is a symptom of another problem.  Or set of problems.  I see wanting more/better gun control as being the equivalent of covering the Check Engine light with a piece of dark tape.

We need to get back to respecting life.  To working problems out.  I've never had a problem where I've seriously considered bringing a gun into it.  Or shooting other people not involved in my beef.  I've also never seriously considered killing myself.  My problems will work themselves out.  It may not always be easy or painless, there may be some embarrassment, but I'll get through it.  It's the way I was brought up.

I'm not a big fan of guns.  I don't own one.  But in the right hands, they are an effective tool with a legitimate use.  When used properly I have no issues with people owning guns.  But we need to instill in our youth how to solve problems and what those legitimate uses are.

c7zi4ty,"&gt;Maybe your so tuned in to it that your numb.

I'm sorry, but that's not making any sense to me. I'm aware of how sad people are, and that makes me numb? Wouldn't numb mean that I was desensitized and therefore was not aware of it?

If you never realized ""how sad my generation is"", what does that imply? That you grew up sheltered? That you ignored it?

Sorry for the tangent, and I don't disagree with you, but I can get obsessive about the precision of meaning.

I'm curious how long you've been in the military. My guess is not very long. I could be wrong. When you've been in the service for a while, you'll get to see how dark the rest of the country is, at least around military bases. PTSD, alcoholism, domestic violence, prostitution, rape, depression, prescription pill abuse, suicide. These problems lie right under the surface of orderly military culture, and are becoming more and more prevalent. If you're not yet aware of these issues, I hope it doesn't come as a surprise when you learn about it.

I'm not in the military, but I've had a lot of friends who are/were.

cn2glhu,"That's a nice neighborhood. Nice middle class area.

 I would assume people there would love the cops being that they have property and a sense of ownership in the community and would want to protect it. Do you have an issue with the prescient in that area? I would assume most of the cops that beat there would know people in the area being that cops on patrol usually do shopping and get lunch in stuff in the community they patrol.

I have made numerous statements that most people in NYC that live in the ghetto, the projects, the economically disadvantaged are minorities.  Are there depressed *white* communities? Sure. But far fewer then minority communities. It's a shitty situation that the majority of minorities are stuck in low income areas and it's a unfortunate coincidence that poor people are more likely to commit crimes. 

In my opinion, cops target minorities under the assumption that people acting a certain way or dressing a certain way might be ""criminal"" and due to the preponderance of minorities in disadvantaged areas in the city, lends to the narrative amongst cops that certain people are more likely to be a criminal then not. 

Objectively speaking, if I saw a black guy walking down the block in a white area with a red du rag, big saggy pants, a red jacket, red shoes, a red hat, and a backpack that *might* be pink-ish... I'm going to have the assumption that he is a Blood looking to rob a house.

dqb3cxx,"Boston is the other major American city that I've lived in longest and know best.

Austin has much more of a 24-hour/late night culture; in New England hardly anything is open 24 hours (including Walmart, McDonald's, etc.) Both cities have great food but I would say that Austin punches above its weight in this category. Obviously Boston has an edge in seafood, Italian, Chinese, etc. while Austin is better for Tex-Mex, barbecue, Mexican, etc. Supermarkets are generally a better value down here though. I would've killed for something like HEB when I lived in Boston. I also think alcohol is more ""accessible"" in Austin. It's funny (and convenient) to see it sold in coffee shops. That said, I have to say overall that there were probably more things to do in Boston that didn't involve eating and drinking.

Austin is way more car-dependent; this is probably the most salient difference for me. It's crazy to look at yelp reviews for restaurants in Austin and see that one of the most common review highlights is ""parking."" There are so many Meetup events I haven't been able to go to because I don't have a car. I mean, it's nice as a passenger that Austin's buses are rarely crowded, but I really miss being able to get everywhere with just my own two feet. (The other major cities I've lived in, like Toronto and some in the UK and France, were much more like Boston in this regard.) The number of truly walkable neighborhoods in Austin is very limited; one of those (downtown) is very expensive/exclusive, and another (UT area) is inhabited almost exclusively by students.

The difference is really stark from a pedestrian safety perspective too. Austin is the first place I've lived where many major and/or central (residential) streets don't have sidewalks. Even the tiny towns I lived in in rural northern Michigan and rural New Hampshire had sidewalks within their cores. In no other city have I come so close to being struck by cars on such a regular basis. It's heartening to see Austin making some changes in this area, but the problem clearly arises from how the metro area has been shaped by zoning and traffic engineering over many decades. Most major streets are much wider here than in Boston, the street lighting is much poorer, etc.

The climate is obviously the other really obvious difference. I don't miss the depressingly early sunsets in Boston (I fully support New England's proposed move to Atlantic Time); I do miss the fall and even the winter, to an extent. Winter in Boston drags on way too long, but it's easier for me to be active in the cold than in Austin's summer heat. I think weather always comes down to personal preference but for me, it's probably a wash. I'd rather be in Boston half the year (May-October) and Austin for the other half (November-April). Austin does have more days that allow for outdoor dining (and a lot more places that offer it), which is nice.

I love the nature on Austin's doorstep (there's nothing like Barton Springs in Boston, although obviously the ocean is pretty cool...). Boston has great natural amenities too but, because the metro area is larger, it often requires a bit longer of a drive to reach some of them. That said, the hill country doesn't really compare to having the White and Green Mountains within reach. Central Texas definitely has the upper hand in caves and cool swimming holes, though. (I will say that Boston's extensive park system always felt more accessible, so I rarely felt the need to leave the city in order to get my nature fix. But Austin has some really cool parks too.)

Cost of living is lower in Austin, although the walkable urban neighborhoods here aren't *that* much cheaper for what they offer. (I did manage to score a 1br in a fairly central location, however, for the same amount I would pay to split a 3br with two roomies in Cambridge). Some things that are extremely rare luxuries in Boston (like in-unit laundry) are much more common in Austin. Car ownership is also much more of a necessary cost here. But if you prefer the suburban lifestyle, I think Austin is probably the easy winner. Greater Boston is nice if you like really large, wooded lots for your suburban home, but housing prices are quite high in comparison.

Cuturally, it's a tough comparison in part because Austin's cultural identity feels much more in flux than Boston's. The Austin metro area is more diverse than Boston's (I think), but the core of Austin oddly feels more segregated to me on a number of levels. I alluded earlier to how UT is surrounded by students, in a way that all the schools in Boston simply aren't (yes, there are lots of students in Harvard Square, but there are tons of non-students, too). Downtown Austin and South Congress and other ""trendy"" parts of the city often feel dominated by Seaport-esque types (for those who know Boston). Gentrification feels much faster and more extreme here. And there simply aren't places like Downtown Crossing or Central Square or Union Square, whatever, where I feel like I see people from all walks of life intermingling on a regular basis. (But this may simply be tied to the difference in car-oriented vs. pedestrian-oriented culture.)

Maybe ""Keep Austin Weird"" is a doomed endeavor, but whatever vestiges of that weirdness remain still make Austin a pretty unique place. A lot of social and class divides in New England are visibly masked by the fact that nearly everyone wears jeans and hoodies (only a slight exaggeration), whereas visible self-expression of identity seems perhaps more encouraged here. I can't think of any area of Boston that really embodies ""weird"" in the same way (although, on the whole, I'd say Jamaica Plain is the most ""Austin"" neighborhood in Boston). Austinites are definitely more outgoing than the famously reserved Bostonians, which I suppose could be good or bad depending on how introverted you are and/or how much you want to actively meet people in social situations. One thing you will find in Austin is a really striking cultural divide between the [city and the countryside](https://i.imgur.com/J9pqX8o.png), something that doesn't quite exist in [New England](https://i.imgur.com/K2MYyQW.png).

[Bathori](http://www.reddit.com/user/bathori) has offered her place for an extra special awesome photography meet-up. This event will give both budding photographers and seasoned professionals plenty of options to choose from:

  * **Landscape** - The home is situated in the hills and has a great view of the city.

  * **Sunset** - We're going to be meeting right before sunset, so we should be able to capture some really beautiful shots of the glowing orange sky.

  * **Night Photography** - It's going to be a full moon, which means gorgeous lighting and we have less of a chance of killing ourselves in the darkness. Also a great chance to try [light writing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_writing).

  * **Headshots** - We’re going to have a couple of studios set up so that you can get headshot experience for your portfolio.

  * **Alt Pin-Ups** - For those of you who like the fun stuff, we’ll also have a studio set up with [Suicide Girl](http://suicidegirls.com/) (link NSFW) models.

If you've got 'em, please bring lighting (strobes, yadda, yadda), backdrops and other paraphernalia to share with your fellow redditors! Also, bring your own bevies and snacks.

Feel free to ask any questions! Also, photographers, please be prepared to send your favorite photos to the models, make-up artists and hair stylists: they're doing this to build their portfolios.

Since this is a private residence, the address will be given only to those who [RSVP](http://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/23178611/).

But, the results were delayed, so that a sporting event would actually be over when anxious bettors thought they were getting ""up to the minute"" reports. A team losing 3-1 at the bottom of the eighth might come from behind with a homer and two runs batted in in the ninth to win the game.

A few years after that, [Statesman Columnist John Kelso visited the Triple J and offered this writeup](https://www.newspapers.com/article/austin-american-statesman-kicker-talk-r/131884167/):

>Kicker Columnist John Kelso continues his search for Central Texas hangouts. We lounged around a table in the Triple Tavern, 52S E. Sixth, talking of kicker subjects. The surroundings made it seem like the thing to do. It's that sort of place.

>...

>When you go to the Triple don't wait for the maitre d' because he's not around just yet and probably never will be. You can tell what kind of place you're dealing with when you look at the walls in the Triple a beer bar that has been around for 30 years. Joseph opened it on Aug. 10, 1950. ""I had a wife, two kids, and $35 when I opened up,"" he said. ""Now I own four buildings on this block. I'm built up pretty good now. I'm what you'd call not a pauper anymore."" There's one sign on the wall that says, ""Leave your bull outside, our cow died."" Bottles of beer are stacked in cardboard boxes under the stairs.

>Another sign sports an ugly cartoon figure carrying a big stick and his message to the world is, ""Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil, 'cause I'm the meanest in the valley."" And there's the walled message that states, **""We don't have a town drunk because we all take turns.""** The in-crowd goes new bars that are down Sixth Street from the Triple J. Joseph doesn't care what's in, or who. He's been around too long to worry about that. ""I believe I'm the oldest (beer) license holder in Austin at least for one man in one location,"" he said. ""I been born and raised on this street.

>I used to shine shoes up and down these curbs. ""When I was a kid I carried boxing gloves around my neck on this street, taking on all comers. We played marbles on East Avenue, where the Interregional is now. It was all gravel. We had watermelon wagons and fruit wagons all along this street.

>""We had trolley cars here, running right down the middle of this street. We'd ride our bicycles, chasing after 'em, us kids, and we'd grab those cars and let 'em give us a ride. Sort of hitchhiking."" While he was talking, a group of regulars playing dominoes ignored us.

It was just a year later that  Kelso covered Papa Joe closing up shop in an article titled [Retiring barkeep recalls gritty past](https://www.newspapers.com/article/austin-american-statesman-retiring-barke/131884332/):

> Joseph John Joseph, 63, the fireplug of a man who recently sold the East Sixth Street bar the old-timers call the Triple Hook, admits he'll miss the old joint some. Even though, over all those years of popping tops, It was a battle. ""You'd miss a suit of clothes if you wore It for 32 years,"" said Joseph while he sat at a table in his dingy bar the one with the dripping air conditioning unit and the cases of beer stacked under the wooden stairs. ""If you had a fingernail for 32 years and you broke it, you're gonna miss it, aren't you? Like they say, if you got a splinter in your finger for a long time and you pull it out, you're gonna miss the pain."" Monday Joseph, whose parents came to the United States from Lebanon in 1909 after riding for three months in a ship's hold, sold his funky beer bar. It's officially known as the Triple Tavern, at 525 East Sixth Street. In the future it won't be a place where the domino players will want to hang out. The old geezers with the hacking coughs who drink beer in the morning will have to move on.

>The joint's going fancy. It will become a shopping mall with a card shop, a European grocery, a flower shop, and the like. THE BAR WILL BE shut down in about a month. Where will the good old boys go from here? Joseph, who recently broke his left arm while ""foolin around, tussling playin'"" in his bar, shrugged his square shoulders. ""When you take a bunch of bees and you throw a rock into the hive,"" he said while sucking on a Camel Light, ""can you tell me where those bees are gonna land next?"" The aforementioned tussling and playing incident Joseph mentioned was certainly not his first encounter of that sort Where Joe grew up, it was tough outside, apparently.

>He was born on East Sixth Street, the son of Salem and Fronia Joseph. Dad was a door-to-door peddler and the owner of a small grocery store. The family didn't have much money, so Joe hit the bricks at an early age. By the time he was ""six or seven"" years old, he was shining shoes on East Sixth, in front of the spot where the Triple Hook now sits. ""TWO CENTS A SHOE, right out front,"" Joe said, pointing out the front door.

>""One time I got polish on a guy's sock, and he kicked my shine box right out in the street."" The Depression was rough, said Joe, who dropped out of school in the fourth grade. The man recalled that occasionally, to get something to eat, he and some of his friends would shoot pigeons with slingshots under the Congress Avenue Bridge. ""Hell, we didn't have anything to eat during the Depression,"" he said. Were the birds any good? he was asked. ""Hell yeah,"" he lied, ""you have to cook 'em a long time, use a cord of wood on 'em."" Still later, Joe picked up a job killing and plucking turkeys at a produce company at Second Street and Congress Avenue.

>He was paid a nickel a bird and remembers one day that seemed like a financial bonanza at the time. There was one tough kid who hung around the place. The boss didn't like him, so he offered Joe 25 cents to run him off. Joe picked a fight with the kid and beat him up. Joe was covered from head to toe with turkey feathers afterward, he said, and it took mamma three bars of soap to clean him up.

>BUT HE GOT HIS quarter. And somewhere In there, Joe boxed in an open air arena that used to be on Riverside Drive. ""They paid me 10 cents a round to fight in a battle royal,"" Joe said, explaining a battle royal is when five people get in the ring all at once, with ""everybody fighting each other."" Things didn't ease off much for Joe when he bought the Triple in 1950. The day the bar opened, he says he took In $7, and there were eight ""brawls and arguments."" ""I tried to give the bar back (to the people he bought It from), but they wouldn't take it,"" Joe remembers. ""The people at the bar were bettin' I wouldn't stay here 30 days, and they came damn near winnin' the bet.

>Some people were sayin', 'old Joe is hardheaded, he'll and others were sayin' I wouldn't."" There's a bullet ding in the Triple Hook's stone bar, representative of the several times when Joe had to put up with trouble. ""There were fist fights, they throwed a few bottles,"" Joe said. ""All of it was minor, it wasn't nuthin' I couldn't handle. Had a few guns pulled on me, and knives. But I took it away from 'em. I got it now to where it's safe to come in here and go to church.""

ecbjce1,"&gt;Photograph of people conversing at a Christmas party, with a man dressed as Santa standing next to a white Christmas tree in the background. Possibly at the Travis County Negro Extension Service building at 1154 Lydia Street, Austin, Texas.

[source](https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth531345/)

You might have thought that Santa only visits children, but this photo proves that notion wrong! Here we see Santa visiting some elderly women attending a Christmas Party at the Travis County (Black) Extension Service back in (I think) the 1950s. One can easily imagine some pleasant holiday music might have been playing on a radio in the background. Spending time catching up with friends and neighbors like these ladies looks like a nice way to commemorate the holiday season.

If you walk by [1154 Lydia Street](https://www.google.com/maps/@30.2691727,-97.7275926,3a,75y,293.24h,86.79t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sptx4y1NPjU16cxqMLHgMoQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) today you see a little house surrounded by condos and offices. Is this the same house the Christmas party from the photo was in? Why was it preserved in SoDoSoPa-like fashion? Also what was an extension service and why was it racially segregated?

Well for the story of the house I turn to [this informative page from the Austin Black Chamber of Commerce](https://austinbcc.org/upcoming-events/schieffer-house-ribbon-cutting-ceremony/). It describes a 2015 ribbon cutting on a restoration of the old house and gives a brief history, from which I quote:

&gt;Built around 1895 by Herman and Annie Schieffer, the Schieffer House at 1154 Lydia was their home for more than 50 years. The Schieffer Family, who built a number of other houses nearby, became prominent members of the community. The grocery and meat market they owned and operated on an adjacent lot served the surrounding neighborhoods through two World Wars and the Great Depression.

&gt;After Herman (April 13, 1863 – January 3, 1946) and Annie (November 2, 1876 to March 14, 1950) had reached their final resting place at Oakwood Cemetery, their East Austin home served as the office of the Negro Agricultural Extension Service. Providing information on everything from crop cultivation and livestock production to home repairs, the agency was a vital information link for African Americans.
In the 1960’s, the Schieffer House became a restaurant and club called La Petite. A gathering place for “movers and shakers” in African American politics, La Petite was at the center of many political campaigns.

&gt;As the fortunes of the neighborhood declined, so did those of Herman and Annie Schieffer’s beloved home at 1154 Lydia Street. Now known as the East Room, it was used as an “after hours club.” The Austin Revitalization Authority (ARA) purchased the property in 1997, and with the support of the surrounding neighborhoods, shut down the club.

&gt;The Austin Revitalization Authority continues to honor East Austin’s rich history by completing the restoration of the Schieffer House. The ARA is celebrating 20 Years of revitalization in East Austin, and that journey began with the purchase of the Schieffer house.

&gt;Through the ARA’s efforts, the property has been completely restored and a 2 story modern addition is being added at the rear of the property. The Schieffer House is located in a highly sought after area near new and exciting restaurants, minutes from the new medical complex, condominium and apartment projects, and a newly built residential area. 

&gt;...

I found [This PDF](http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=189498) from the Austin Revitalization Authority which describes in copious detail the restoration and the building of the adjoining buildings. So that part was answered. But what about the Extension service? What was that about?

For help in explaining that I turn to the great archivist bloggers down at the [Travis County Archives](https://tcarchivesarchives.wordpress.com/about/) who have a couple of different historyposts about the extension services. It was the subject of their [2014 history day event](https://tcarchivesarchives.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/travis-county-history-day-2014-2/). For those like myself who missed this in 2014, they have [another page with a brief explanation](https://tcarchivesarchives.wordpress.com/2014/05/28/from-travis-countys-rural-roots/), from which I quote:

&gt;Soon after Travis County was established in 1840, the population was reported to be a mere 856 residents. This number grew quickly, however, and by 1850 it had surpassed 3,000. The city of Austin grew faster than the county as a whole, but most county residents lived in small communities, and the area was still very much at the edge of the frontier.

&gt;By 1890, Travis County’s population had grown to approximately 36,000 residents, less than half of which lived within the city of Austin. Even though Austin’s population continued to grow, by the turn of the century the majority of the county’s residents still lived on farms or in smaller towns, and agriculture dominated the area economy.

&gt;Such rural and agricultural-based communities were in mind when Congress approved the Smith-Lever Act in 1914, a federal law that established a nationwide cooperative extension service and provided for state-based agricultural services to benefit farms and communities.

&gt;Even as the population within Austin surpassed the number of residents living in the county’s outlying communities, and as Travis County gradually transformed from a rural community to an urban one, extension services played an important role in the development and betterment of Travis County and its residents. With programs such as 4-H, horticulture, agriculture and natural resources, family and consumer sciences, residents had access to valuable information and resources that helped improve lives.

&gt;2014 marks the 100th anniversary of the passing of Smith-Lever Act, and Travis County History Day will be celebrating the contributions of the AgriLife Extension Service in the growth and development of our community. Please mark your calendars for the morning of October 24, 2014, and join us in learning about and celebrating this valuable service.

Ahh, so it was a service for farming co-ops, and even as Austin urbanized north and south in the mid 20th century, many farmers still happened to live on the racially segregated eastern side of town. It turns out I had posted pics of the fruits of the labors of these cooperative farming extension services without really realizing it [in the Bonus pics of an old historypost I made about Rosewood Park](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/7uzjgo/children_playing_in_rosewood_park_unknown_date/).  I don't know if there was a similar 'Pan-American' extension service for people of Hispanic origin but [this would follow the pattern displayed in other areas](https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth124633/) of local government if true.  There was [an Austin History Center exhibit](https://library.austintexas.gov/ahc/cleaning-stones-and-sowing-seeds-444715)  on the subject that I'm sorry I missed earlier this year, but if anyone happened to see it or knows a little something more about these topics feel free to speak up!
 
Today the extension services are thankfully integrated and continue in more rural areas outside of Travis County. If I understand them correctly the ones for this area are now administered by Aggies who ought to know about these things at Texas A&amp;M.

Bonus pics today are all UNT archive photos from Christmas seasons of Austin's past.

j92mqeb,"As a mental health practitioner who works with chronically suicidal folks, this is a horrible idea that will absolutely lead to more preventable deaths.

&gt;even modest behavioral requirements for housing

This is generally not feasible for most folks in mental health crisis, and it leads to even more folks being out on the streets.  You can't actually make it into, or through, recovery when your environment is constantly pushing you towards death or chemical escapism.  It's nearly impossible for someone to manage that.  

Making folks go into mental health services when they're not ready is the easiest way to get them killed by their own hand.  Folks have to be willing to have any hope of success.  That's just one, of many reasons, why forcing someone into an inpatient facility often doesn't do much for them, and it can sometimes make things drastically worse.

I work with many housing programs that have things like behavioral and ""productivity"" requirements.  Some people do pretty well with it - and even like it, but folks who aren't ready for that still deserve to not be on the streets suffering.  Sometimes people have to be able to come down out of raw survival mode and heal some before they can go through recovery.  I damn sure did when I was the one going through it; I might have died if I hadn't had friends who let me stay on their couch.  It took me a few months of having a roof over my head to come down, but eventually, I was in a place to get help.

Anyway, I guess this is a long way for me to say, if you care about people's mental health and ability to recover, pushing someone into it before they're ready is only going to sabotage them.  You might make their suicidal ideation worse, and you'll almost certainly spike their self-hatred, which can often create destructive feedback loops.

fqowakd,"I understand your frustration. When you look at the initiative head on, it sounds absolutely insane. It sounds like you're encouraging substance abuse and rewarding irresponsible behavior. From an outside perspective, it looks like it could very well only exacerbate the problem. But it makes more sense when you look into it further. 

The status quo that we currently have responds to those with addiction problems by putting them in prison. The response is not to help them. In fact, despite 85% of people in US prisons qualifying as having a Substance Abuse Disorder, only 5% of those incarcerated individuals recieve treatment. All it does is remove them from society. However, imprisonment comes with its own set of issues. After you are released from incarceration, it becomes nearly impossible to find a job as many employers do not want to hire someone with a criminal record. It also becomes extremely difficult to attain housing as many renters are wary about renting to someone imprisoned for drug crimes. This makes it extremely hard for someone vulnerable to drug addiction to be able to make it in society. Because of this, those released from prison are at a higher risk of relapse and overdose than the general population. 

Drug abuse is a response to misery. Humans often seek temporary solutions to relieve them of their misery. By putting people prone to addiction in a situation where they cannot find a job, cannot find housing, and cannot make something of their lives, we are asking, nay begging them to relapse. You may be thinking (Well, they should not have gotten hooked in the first place. No one forced them to take drugs.) And you would likely be correct. Very few are forced into trying drugs. But millions of people are put into absolutely miserable situations where they desperately search for any way to numb the pain. If Johnny got a call that his the love of his life was diagnosed with terminal cancer, we would understand if he began drinking more. It isn't right and is an extremely unhealthy coping mechanism,  but we can understand why it occured. People do illogical things during times of greif. The same is true for other drugs. If Janet was born into an abusive family and sustained lifelong trauma from it, and ended up turning to heroin because it finally makes the voices telling her she's not good enough and should jump out of a window go away, most of us could understand where she is coming from. She needs help. Not to be thrown in prison.

Drugs are not the true cause of addiction. Misery is. Drugs are simply a method to gain temporary happiness. Alcohol is a very addictive drug. Hell, cannabis can also be addictive. So are many prescription and over the counter medications. Yet most of us are able to use these drugs recreationally or medicinally. We are not to the point where our lives are so miserable that we would do anything for some form of temporary bliss. But unfortunately millions of people are. You may see an eratic methhead going to war with the shadow people on a street corner, but in reality, they are a person genetically predisposed to addiction who was the sole survivor of a car accident that took the lives of their parents and best friend. Confused and alone, they were unable to cope. After a few failed suicide attempts, they turned to meth just to feel some semblance of happiness again. And sadly, the meth worked. They became addicted to not hating themselves for surviving and not feeling suicidal anymore and now roam the streets looking to find and kill the last shadow demon.

I use these examples because they are stories I have heard from those suffering from addiction. However I will say that not all people suffering with addiction experience trauma. But addiction is and always will be a response to lack of appreciation for where you currently are in life, and a desire to change it.

What this bill does is decriminalize low level possession of substance use (while keeping sale and manufacture illegal) issue a civil citation, and route addicts to treatment facilities rather than prison. It recognizes that what we have done to those with addiction problems has failed. Since we began the war on drugs, all we have done is increase the amount of people with addiction problems and refuse to give addicts the chance to clean up.


I sadly am not from your city. However, I do live in a community absolutely ravaged by the opioid epidemic. I believe my county is actually in the top ten for overdoses from opioids. We are still recovering from a major issue with fentanyl. I would give anything to see an initiative like this pass in my city. I urge you not to let this opportunity pass. You have the chance to give thousands of addicts the chance they need to get help. Throwing them in prison has done nothing but make it more likely that they will relapse and overdose when released. I believe that this measure has the power to save thousands, if not tens of thousands of lives over time.

ky4gyi4,"This issue boils down to psychology and the need for comprehensive education. Why does our society allow individuals to reach such dire circumstances? We are raising individuals ill-equipped to navigate life's challenges. There's a lack of resilience taught in schools, and no curriculum addressing coping mechanisms for breakups or trauma. People must learn these skills proactively, not reactively. If you come from a family that didn't provide a supportive environment, the likelihood of experiencing depression, homelessness, or other hardships increases significantly. Addressing victim mentality and helplessness, and fostering empowerment are key. We must teach coping strategies for life's adversities, instilling a sense of capability and self-esteem, so individuals can confidently affirm: 'I'm worthy, capable, and there is hope in this situation.""

Frankly, the individualists who carry society will withdraw their support as the collectivist decay sets in and everyone, to some degree, will reap the fruits of what unlimited tolerance (having no standards and permitting no ""failure"" and thus granting no individual accountability) has wrought.

No one gets out of this life alive, but the mentality you have adopted, that we must have perfect safety, is creating a world that is not worth living in. You people just refuse to see it, and double down on authoritarianism because you ""care"" so much. It's a form of undisciplined and unprincipled suicide.

Anecdotally, I haven't had a vaccine in about 10 years and I haven't been sick since. My choice not to vaccinate for COVID doesn't affect anyone's INDIVIDUAL decision and right to do so or not to do so. For the people who want to spread fear to change this fundamental freedom of bodily autonomy, that's a red line. 

Some people are willing to die to enforce red lines. I don't think you'd understand this sentiment though as sacrifices for freedom (that is winning power back from authoritarians) have always required blood, and a whole lot of it.

fx9zahx,"&gt; Except public transit, what is missing in these places from your list? Fwiw, most of the things you listed are better further from Seattle (mountains, nature)

I just didn't provide a full list of my wants here because I didn't think I needed it. So in terms of what I need in terms of day-to-day nature access, I need parks with wifi accessibility so I have some variety in where I go out and throw a blanket down many days to work. Preferably with plenty of people as I like to people watch and chat with people randomly. I want mountains and forests accessible for day trips and weekend trips, I don't need them every day. I need lots of coffee shops, I like having plenty of retail variety to break up my day. Lots of bike infrastructure so I can get out and ride around to see people and things going on. Plenty of public transit for if I need to get farther away, but preferably I can walk to everything I need, including groceries and day-to-day needs. I also like things like visual variety in my buildings, different heights and styles, neighborhoods I can reach on foot that are distinctive from others nearby, lots of restaurant options I can get to on foot, and while I may be over 30 and married, I do still like nightlife reachable on foot too.

That's a few more of the things. Working remote for years now has made me want a lot of these things MORE as I can integrate them into my day-to-day life even more than if I had to spend every day in an office.

gaewi1w,"&gt;  No, I see examples of white people who killed as opposed to a black person whose family called for an ambulance. Yes they had a weapon, they did not deserve to die.

Again, none of that is the key difference between these scenarios. You're completely ignoring what I've said. The key difference is how the assailants in question act towards police. It's not about race, its about threatening behavior towards cops.

&gt; You would have to be willfully ignorant to think interactions that black people have with police aren’t wildly different than those that white people have with police. The obvious root of that is prejudice.

That may or may not be, but the specific comparison you've made does not provide evidence for that claim. You need to look at actual data to support, let alone prove, such a claim. I've personally looked through much of the available data. The picture that emerges is not one of a systemically racist police force. I see a picture of a socioeconomically disadvantaged group with higher crime rates and a mostly proportional response from the police. There appears to be perhaps a small difference in the way that police treat petty crimes perpetrated by black people vs other races, but its not clear to me that this can simply be attributed to widespread racism among police officers, especially considering that black people are actually less likely to be killed in altercations with police than white people, on a per incident basis.

&gt; The fact that you participate in the Jordan Peterson subreddit and come to this one to justify your worldview is also very telling.

A very reddit moment. I can just imagine you frantically searching through my post history for something to smear me with instead of engaging with the arguments I put forth. Anything to maintain the fragile Critical Race Theory ideology that so obviously dominates your thinking. I understand it hurts to question your own moral convictions, but I encourage you to keep an open mind and look beyond popular talking points. We are all humans and sometimes the things we think are obviously true and universal are actually a result of our own personal biases. Look into the data for yourself, and try to remain objective while you do so.

Fact is, Mr. Wallace is responsible for his own actions. If you charge towards police threatening them with a deadly weapon, and repeatedly ignore their commands for you to drop said weapon, then you're really the only one responsible for your own untimely death. Mr. Wallace killed himself; it was quite obviously suicide by cop.

That being said, I do think there should be better training and options for the police to deal with such situations to prevent deaths where possible. In this case the police clearly didn't have enough backup, nor did they have access to tasers or other non-lethal means of subduing a dangerous assailant, but that may not exactly be the fault of the police. Its likely a funding or politics issue. In any case, rioting in response to this will do nothing but encourage people to vote for the ""Law and Order"" candidate in upcoming elections.

cq4b3g9,"    but you can't actually make any real progress when you have such massive debt burdens tied to your ankles

That is not true at all. The New Deal and Keynesian economics proves this. In the 1930s we had the [most debt](http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Total-US-Debt-As-A-Percentage-Of-GDP.jpg) in our history before the 2008 financial collapse. What brought us out of the Great Depression was mainly government investments that created jobs. We could've ended the Great Depression much earlier had the fear of ""debt"" not made FDR scale back the New Deal in 1937. This led to more years of terrible depression and it was only until WWII scared us into serious gov. spending and job creation that we really got out of the crisis. 

Rahm's ""solutions"" to our debt and financial problems are merely making the poor the middle class pay for them. Instead of a progressive tax change (which Chuy supports) Rahm closed 49 schools on the south and west side, sold off city services to his investment banker friends and used red light cameras to get an extra $100 from the single mom driving to her 2nd job.

I'm not arguing that excess painkillers lead to more people hooked on heroin, but there are lots of reasons that people get addicted to drugs.  Yes, someone can be prescribed painkillers and become a heroin addict but without other factors involved (e.g. a predisposition to addiction, someone from a depressed economic area who doesn't see/have opportunities for their future, PTSD, a doctor over-prescribing them, etc) it is very unlikely to happen.  There are even people who want the FDA to remove the approval for these drugs in an effort to fight addiction which would cause far more harm to the majority people who are prescribed them for pain management and benefit from their use.
  
My point is that if you want to address addiction you need to look for the root cause.  The drugs themselves may have addictive properties, but if the majority of people take them and don't become addicted then obviously that is not the sole reason.  
  
Demonizing these substances is what led to the failed war on drugs, the majority of the effort was aimed at eradicating the supply while the cause for the demand was ignored.",comment,Boston,0

jntkwc8,"I am so very sorry you’re feeling this way, and please know you aren’t alone despite how real that might sometimes feel. There’s a tiered way of thinking of self care and mental health, and there are things you can do now, and things you can implement moving forward. Perhaps you’ve done many of these things, just just in case: 

1) Call 988 if or when you need it (the 24/7 national crisis line) - they can also help with accessing local resources 

2) call out to your tribe, which you’ve done here (yay!), but if you have trusted others in your life, tell them where you are and let them be with you in this. Foster and cultivate that support system

3) Eat well, have a positive routine that includes sleep hygiene, mindfulness, regular physical exertion of some type, and doing something everyday that fills your cup somewhat 

4) start a gratitude journal. This is an under-appreciated strategy and is more complex that it seems on the surface. Practicing intentional gratitude creates and strengthens neural pathways that enable our brains to recognize and acknowledge positive things without conscious thought, which helps enhance positive neurotransmission, which helps combat the chemical imbalance of depression

5) I mentioned exercise but I’m gonna reiterate that it also changes the neurochemicals in the brain in a positive way. This doesn’t have to be gym-related, it can be a walk, manual labor on a project you enjoy, just get moving 

6) clean and organize your place. The state of our external environment is often a reflection of our internal state, and while finding that motivation can be a bitch, making those external tweaks can help internally too 

7) find a competent mental health provider. If medications would be helpful, find a competent psychiatrist coupled with a therapist. The waitlists can be somewhat daunting but less-so if you’re open to virtual services. Don’t give up. And if you get a shitty one or two, don’t give up. There are great ones out there. A previous poster mentioned DBT, and that’s a solid rec. also consider CBT, EMDR, and other evidence-based treatments for depression/anxiety and trauma (if that’s a component of your struggle). 

8) cultivate resilience. Resilience is something we can be crushing in one are of our life, but may be neglecting in other areas. And life is hard as shit, so finding new ways to build and grow our ways of navigating our own challenges helps us stay ahead of the game. 

Don’t give up. Please don’t give up. I don’t have to know you personally to know that you matter to people, and that people love the fuck out of you. There are others in this world who need you and haven’t even met you yet. 🩵",comment,Austin,1

Unfortunately, the DOH doesn't let me see the leading causes of death by age and gender, however in 2021 there 265 women who died due to self-harm and 960 men who died due to the same reason.

kbrzoft,"Less than 5% of readers of a post comment on a post.


Similarly like primary or midterm elections. Only pissed off or hyper opinionated folks do it with any consistency. 

So when liberals on this sub decry police shootings on a reddit post, and are dismissal about looting...theyre obviously motivated by previously held beliefs on police and megacorps.

Or when conservatives on this sub cheer a home invader death. Theyre just voicing their previously held opinions on 2nd Ammendment, the DA, and how they see the world when it comes to safety over liberty.

So its not crudish folks changing opinions based on a particular news post or or novel set of circumstances. 

Its just that the bar of posting a comment is high. And it lowers in proportion on how intense you feel about a subject.

Which is why 35% GOP primary voters have lost the plot and are undereducated, economicly depressed, and isolationist... and now 80% of registered Republicans are seen as racist, fear mongering, leave it beaver 1950s lovers.

Fair or not. Its the nature of small sections of society getting a vote when there arent a lot of votes counted.

A Lousiana governor was once asked. ""Why are the quality of your prisons so poor?"".

He replied, ""Probably has something to do with the quality of our inmates"".

You know why since 2010 the GOP has given up any previous held ideologies on Free Trade, Immigration,  Debt, Or Foreign Policy? Because the quality of their voters has fallen wayyy off. 

Instead of country clubs and chambers of commerce folks choosing the candidates. Its poor, rural, brown collar ( non union step below blue collar folks) types folks who are poorer than their parents because of globalization and the rust belt dying and who are more susceptible to propangda of scare tactics and scape goating from simple feckless vapid blowhard populists.",comment,LosAngeles,0
rc5li2,"Is crime targeting apartments on the rise or something? So I've been looking into other apartments in the area and this is so insanely depressing. I've generally been shying away from the high crime areas, such as Slabtown/Peral/Downtown. I'd be more comfortable going for those if I didn't have to worry about taking the dogs out to go to bathroom after dark. So as a result most of my searching has been on the east side looking for 1br apartments that have garage parking + allow pets. I have been absolutely floored at how many apartments with availability have had multiple google reviews in the past 6 months complaining about vandalism, car break ins (yes, cars inside of a 150+ a month garages), and packages being stolen. It's not just a specific area either. South Portland, Lloyd's, Kerns, Boise, etc. If you go based on the google reviews, it seems to be getting worse. And these are places charging 1900+ a month for a 1 bedroom. The whole market for Apartments in this city seems to have taken a nose dive in the past year.

gjuyngt,"&gt;""we"" as in americans, not as in we all agree on the policy. jesus fucking christ dude.

Thanks for clarifying.  Unfortunately, ""we"" Americans would still not be very much like the UK or Australia, even if we had their gun laws.  America is physically much larger, has a much much higher population, and is more diverse in terms of income, race, and a number of other factors.  Those two countries are also islands, whereas the US shares a 3000 mile long insecure land border with one of the world's leading illegal drug producers (not holding the US blameless for that of course; we want to buy it, can't blame other countries for selling it, but the fact remains, it's a huge source of crime).

&gt;you're also not really here in good faith if you're putting up arbitrary restrictions on the discussion. you only wanna talk about evidence about guns as a ""causal factor""? like no shit sherlock, guns don't cause homicide or suicide. the problem is how much easier and successful those actions are with guns.

Yes, of course I'm only interested in causal factors, and I'm kind of flabbergasted that anyone would not be, because we should be IMO.  If we're not interested in causal factors, and we're trying to reduce murders by reducing the number of guns, then we have admitted we have literally no idea whether it will work.  We have no idea if a ""disarmed society"" will have fewer murders and suicides or not.  If they don't cause it, then banning them is completely arbitrary.  Literally for all we know, we could magically evaporate all guns and the murder rate would be completely unchanged.  In fact, Australia's own experience with their gun confiscation demonstrated that might well be the case.

[edited to change the target of my argument]

&gt;and instead of understanding why people would be in favor of what they're in favor of, you're just stewing in whatever position you've entrenched yourself in.

~~My good man, welcome to the entrenched club.  But in an effort to dig ourselves out, here's my question: why do you want to ban guns and have a disarmed society if you have no evidence that it will *cause* fewer murders or suicides?  (Or if you have such evidence, please post it so I can see it too.)  What is your goal in having a disarmed society?  What will make it better than an armed society, and more importantly, *how* will being disarmed specifically bring that about?~~

kpzl7qc,"I’ll tell you some things my friends who are parents do: Join a group of other parents or parents doing activities with kids (hiking is a good one). Go to things at community centers, farmer’s markets, free craft activities at small city festivals or whatever listed in Parent Map. You will definitely meet like minded people who want to make friends on a time schedule that is closer to yours. Also, parents of your children’s friends, neighbors who have kids. Go to the pet the instruments thing at the symphony, kid concerts at town hall. Ask people at those events if they have a playgroup or something you can join (not if they want to know you right now, better to ask for a lower stakes group they can get to know you in). Get a “Mommy’s Helper” child to watch your child and befriend their parents. Join mom or dad or parent meetup groups. Join a Unitarian Universalist church if you are non denominational/not super religious/don’t mind just sitting around in order to meet people. Many of these activities are low cost. Expect to meet a lot of other people who are from out of state. Ask people for very low stakes get togethers like meeting at a playground or park near them, or for coffee. A Bbq with you is not low stakes for us, I’ll explain why a bit later. 

In my experience, people who have kids want to talk about their kids. That is cool but as a non kid person this is like hearing someone drone on about their dog being the most precious being in the universe. I hate to be honest here but I just do not care as much as you care and having not been through the experience of children I cannot relate. It is also difficult as a working person to meet people who have kids at times that work for me. My home is not childproofed so I have to meet you at a different location or at your home as well. The city has more dogs than kids, so you will have less of a crowd to get to know, but people are out there. 

Also, you cannot make anybody be your friend if they don’t want to be. The majority of Seattlites who grew up here have their five friends they want to have and they don’t want to get to know more people. I know this sounds grumpy. It is, but it also is because the definition of friendship is different here than in other places in the US. In my experience Seattlites want to discuss big ideas or deep personal things. This takes more effort and depth than what most of the US considers friends. It’s almost like everyone here is poly but for friendships. Few Seattlites are interested in “superficial” friendships where you just make small talk at bbqs with people you don’t really know. It is considered off putting because we all have seasonal depression and it is a majority introvert city. It takes energy to make small talk and do things and combat traffic. If you live outside of Seattle proper such as the Eastside, do not expect a person from Seattle to ever visit you. I do not know why but there is nothing you can do to entice a city person to leave it, it’s like they have to get a visa to cross the bridge. Combine this with it being a city of less than social tech workers (generalization but in my experience often true), you just will have a hard time meeting people. So, to a certain extent you have to accept that it will likely be a full time strugglebus to meet people. Old Seattle culture is derived from a high population of Scandinavian immigrants and in general this is a more “standoffish” culture. When I moved from Seattle to the East Coast I thought it was rude that people would talk to me in the grocery store line because it felt at the time like an invasion of my personal space and also who they hell are they. Honestly at the time if someone showed up to my door to introduce themselves because they moved in recently with a pie like apparently people do in the South I would assume they have an ulterior motive and/or are a serial killer, lol. I joke but also… Took me a while to realize that other cultures in the US are way more open to “hey I just met you let’s do a fun thing” and consider this to be a level of friendship vs friendly acquaintances. It’s almost like we are a bunch of cats and the rest of the US seems like deranged golden retrievers. 

To combat seasonal depression, get outside to exercise and get 15 mins of sunlight a day on your face via outdoor light or one of those SAD lights. Make sure you take vitamin D, omega 3 supplements. If you come from an area that is very sunny, make sure you take extra care to do all these things. Seattlites are less accustomed to sun and seem to “need” less of it than other people who move here, in my experience. Spend time in nature (2 hours is the same as a mild antidepressant which is why we all love the outdoors) and join a group activity where you can lightly socialize (even just a small amount makes a difference) like park play dates or making small talk with your neighbors when they are mowing the lawn. I’m sorry we are such misanthropes here. 48% of us have clinical depression and this makes things really challenging. We are literally No 1 in the country for most depressed in the country, lol! 

You can meet people and find cool folks, but just try to befriend us like cats, one social morsel at a time. Also, try being open to very deep but fewer friendships.",comment,Seattle,1

fqj4w85,"aaaand that's why you don't fund your transit system through fares. It almost seems _designed_ to fail. When fares are the primary funding source, they necessarily must keep rising every year due to inflation and increasing costs of maintenance as the population increases. But funding it from fares also makes the public think that a public service like this should run profitably like a business, which then makes them balk at the idea of raising fares when they can't even provide a decent level of service. This viscous cycle ensures transit is always underfunded and service never meaningfully improves. It also allows layfolk like our, um, elected political leadership grandstand like this without replacing the revenue the fair hike would have provided.

the _correct_ way to fund transit is through taxes like every other public service. Every single property owner within 10 minutes of a Muni stop has been the undeserving beneficiary of public dollars – their property values have exploded because of money _you and I_ put into the system through taxes, yet they get to keep 100% of the rewards, having done literally nothing but having enough money to own property and being lucky enough to have that property near a transit stop. If you want transit to run well, ***some*** that value _must_ be **recaptured** in the form of land value taxes, and that money can be reinvested into the system and used to hire more muni drivers which, if you didn't already know, is the reason why so many busses run on fucking 30 minute headways here.

dnybder,"&gt; However, as long as you are considering restricting constitutional rights of law abiding citizens to save lives, 

Any stats on how many lives guns **save**? Because they took 33000 in 2014. About 21000 of those were suicides and 11000 were homicides. 

&gt;maybe we should be ban facebook and other social media that has been shown to cause depression and suicidal ideation.

Except we have tangible statistics that say that 21000 people killed themselves with guns. How many did as a result of social media? We also have extraordinarily compelling evidence that shows less access to guns means less suicides. Where is that research for social media? You are trying to fight actual facts with hearsay and conjecture. 

Besides which, gun control could literally mean anything. Could mean no automatic weapons. Or it could mean putting a three week waiting period. Or it could mean a mandatory firearm class. Or it could mean shooting the leg of everyone who wants to buy a gun so they know what it feels like. Or it could mean just making sure that someone is not a felon. Or it could mean that we make it so guns can't fire more than a bullet a second. Or it could mean a stiff fine for manufacturing gun parts without a license. Or it could mean LITERALLY A BILLION THINGS that still allow you to own a gun while making it less likely for people to use guns on themselves or other people without just cause.

dh3869a,"Interesting, thanks. Hadn't read the bill, just presumed similarity to WA or CA's model. It lays out a procedure far more similar to a warrant application than I'd have imagined. 

Looking at the bill, I think §2 has some pretty concerning language, particularly (4)(c)(D) (a DUI is to be considered relevant in this context?), and (4)(d) (""evidence"" - not conviction - of unlawful use of controlled substances?). That is pretty damn questionable.

Having now read it, there's one issue in your comment:

&gt; At the trial... There is no cause of the State trying to prove you've done something wrong - it's the polar opposite: you have to prove you intend to do nothing wrong, and you're pronounced guilty of potential wrong doing before you're even notified of the court's opinion.

That's objectively incorrect, as it's both (a) a violation of OECs, and more specifically (b) the polar opposite of your claim is stated in this very bill. 

From the section covering hearing procedure, §3(3)(b): ""The petitioner [the government] has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent presents a risk in the near future, including an imminent risk, of suicide or of causing physical injury to another person."" 

The ""clear and convincing"" evidentiary standard / burden on the state is well-developed in Oregon jurisprudence, and 9th Circuit standing law, and places the burden unequivocally on the petitioner of this protection order, not ""the polar opposite."" 

Whether you feel this hearing would be a ""kangaroo court"" or not, if there's a questionable satisfaction of the evidentiary standard put forth in §3(3)(b) of this bill (which mirrors many other ORSs), the OR Ct. App. would eat this shit up (as they frequently do).  

But other than particulars, I think we're in agreement. The language of this bill is questionable, and pre-hearing, creates a pretty imbalanced situation I don't think would have a prayer on appeal for DP claim or just its missing conformity with established crim procedure. ",comment,Portland,0

dzbj8gb,"It's not that the media should stop covering the shootings, it's that the media needs to stop coverage that glorifies the killer. Mental health professionals have, for a long time, been making serious recommendations about *how* mass shootings should be covered, not that they shouldn't be covered. That is what the last highlighted paragraph is pointing out. They can still talk about the shootings, they can talk about the victims. What they should avoid is plastering the photo and names of the shooters everywhere. They should avoid posting their screeds and diatribes (think that video from that ""incel shooter"" that they played everywhere). Research has shown that many of these shooters want fame and believe that, by committing these shootings, that their stories will be told, because that is what the media has done with previous shooters. [The Santa Fe shooter didn't shoot people that he liked so he could ""have his story told"".](https://apnews.com/cb5e0dca766e4845acf02b6bff8b62c7)

Furthermore, there has been extensive research on the social contagion of suicide and the effects the media plays.

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00031539.htm

https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/upshot/the-science-behind-suicide-contagion.html

http://time.com/5137194/robin-williams-suicide-rate/

Furthermore, she hasn't found correlation. Her paper (which you can read in the link at the bottom), is a summation of other research on the topic:

&gt;For compelling evidence, Towers et al. (2015) utilized a mathematical contagion model that has been previously used to test whether the spread is “contagious” of stock market decisions, viral YouTube videos, burglaries and infectious disease outbreaks, to test for the first time, the “contagiousness” of media portrayals of active shooters. If the actual dates of shootings fit the model that indicates time-related contagion, or the actual locations of shootings fit the model that indicates regional contagion, and could not be due to chance, then we can determine that current events have been directly influenced by past events, and we can predict the timing and locations of future contagion. In fact, the authors did discover a temporal contagion among all datasets (USA today 4 or more deaths, Brady Bill 4 or more deaths, and Brady Bill school shootings) except one (Brady Bill 3 or fewer deaths). Moreover, the rate of mass shootings has escalated to, on average, one every 12.5 days in the United States, and one school shooting happens on average every 31.6 days. The most disturbing finding is that for every three incidents, at least one new incident is guaranteed, or copied, within 13 days. The contagion for school shootings is slightly weaker: for every four to five incidents, a new incident is copied within 13 days. The authors note that although it is clear a contagion is present, they cannot determine what caused the contagion based on the model alone, such as our assumption that the contagion is mass media coverage. They can only determine presence or no presence of contagion. However, it is hard to posit alternatives as to how one mass shooter learned of another mass shooter, other than through mass media. Added to that is that the authors did not find a spatial contagion, in other words, the model indicating a regional contagion was non-significant, so the authors speculate that information about shootings is happening nationwide, rather than regionally. A possibility is that news of shootings is spread through social media in addition to mass media.
&gt;       
&gt;      
&gt;   To test that theory, and using a different method than Towers et al. (2015), Garcia-Bernardo et al. (2015) hypothesized that if mass shooting attacks are unrelated and evenly distributed, rather than clustered, there will be an equal probability that any one attack happens recently or much later than another event, and near or far from another event. They aimed to evaluate whether temporal and spatial relationships exist between attacks based on social media big data analysis. Fifty-seven billion tweets were analyzed, from which were extracted 72 million tweets with the word “shooting” in them, and about two million tweets with the words “school shooting” or “mass murder” in them. The researchers then compared the social media data with a database of mass shootings incidents, including day and place of shooting. They selected the database used by Schulz et al. (2013), Everytown.org’s database for 2014 (both of which are missing some events—see above), yet the authors still identified a strong contagion effect. When tweets about school shootings went beyond 10 per million, the probability of a school shooting in the next eight days went up to 50%. Nineteen days following the shooting, if tweets went beyond ten per million, the probability of another shooting went to 85%. Finally, if tweets went beyond ten per million in the 35 days following a shooting, it was nearly 100% likely that another shooting occurred. The authors also determined that school shootings are more influenced by social media than other mass shootings, however social media is still able to predict that the first ten days after an attack are most contagious for another attack, especially when tweets about mass shooting reach more than 45 per million. Also, unfortunately, the  number of tweets about a shooting is linked to higher number of fatalities in the next few shootings.

lneu1wq,"Graduated from the university of Michigan in 2023 with a Bachelors of Arts in sociology and a minor in quantitative methods for the social sciences (aka coding for data analytics) and a variety of different internships. Spent a solid 6ish months applying to 500 positions and realized that college degrees are quite useless / impossible to get your foot in the door. and decided to make a career pivot into nursing currently in a 2 yr nursing program (half way done) and working full time as an administrative assistant at a medical clinic (I make about 42k and I’m not satisfied so definitely looking for greener pastures. 


Now that I got my negative experience out of the way advice for new grads in the job search: 

1.) do internships and especially in big companies so that you can make connections and sometimes do pipeline hiring (aka they take you in as interns and can potentially hire you once you graduate) 

2.) use a google sheet or excel spreadsheet to write down all the roles you applied to when you applied and the status (was it rejected, interviewing etc) 

3) get an internship or part time job while doing your job search so you have some income coming in 

4) dedicate a specific number of time to applying to jobs each day just don’t make it your sole focus 24/7 otherwise you’ll go crazy / get depressed ( eg each day I will apply to 5 jobs or I’ll dedicate x amount of hours applying to jobs ) 

Otherwise best of luck everyone ! ",comment,Austin,1

cf76o8d,"There are really only two general ways to really reduce inequality and improve the lot of the lower classes through government intervention: increasing their income through direct measures (higher minimum wages, basic incomes, universal healthcare, etc), and through higher marginal tax rates. Distorting markets is almost never a good idea. 

A good example of how policies targeted at helping the poor end up hurting them is [rent control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_control). Rent control, intended to keep prices low for low income people, [ends creating artificial scarcity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJvTTGOHFkU#t=281), ultimately driving prices up, causing landlords to neglect properties, and discouraging mobility. 

Efforts against gentrification often have similar perverse effects, punishing low income property owners by depressing the value of their property, discouraging development, discouraging job creation, concentrating crime, overburdening social support services, and often lowering the tax base for a city. In reality, actual displacement from gentrification is often very low, generally only slightly over 5%. The poorer families that stay tend to benefit from increased property value, better access to community resources, lower crime rates, better city services and more overall opportunities.

That is not to say there are no costs. For those who stay, there is often the danger of increased rent or increased property taxes. If this doesn't force a person to move, it can lower the household income, which may never be offset by better opportunities. This is one reason why I think a more generous minimum wage and or basic income is an important consideration, as are things like universal healthcare, so that the effects of gentrification can be offset through actual income growth of the lower and middle classes rather than market distortions that end up being exploited by savvy market operators, rarely to the benefit of the lower classes.

jig25zm,"I agree with most of what you said and I’m going to ramble now too. Goaltending cratered, sure, but the defense was so bad that Ullmark HAD to stand on his head for any chance to win a couple of those games because the defense was just giving the puck to Florida in the defensive zone. Ullmark did get too excited and flopped everywhere, which burned us a few times, but ultimately defense was public enemy number 1 for us. Swayman was not the problem in game 7. First goal wasn’t great, but he responded well the rest of the game.

Forbort was absolutely brutal those last few games. Clifton was horrific in his few outings. I would’ve liked to see Zboril and Gryz in for those two in game 7. Yes, they’re both LHD but Zboril has played at RD before. It was clear after games 5 and 6 we needed wholesale changes on the bottom pairing because they were straight up being exploited. Gryz had a rough game, but no way to know that would happen going into it so I was fine with the decision.

I hate to say it, but I wish Bergeron didn’t play those last three games. He didn’t look bad, but you could tell he was still fighting something, which we found out is a herniated disk. Krejci came back and did well, 3 points in game 7, but something felt off on his line. Maybe it’s just Florida was more physical and taking it to them? I’m honestly not sure.

This one just flat out hurts. It really felt like the last ride for Bergy and Krejci and to get bounced in the first round after having a regular season where they owned just about everyone, had resilience to complete come backs in the regular season, and the depth… this really felt like it had to be THE cup run or that was it.

If Bergy and Krejci come back, this team is still a contender in my opinion. If they don’t, probably a bubble team that sneaks in as a #3 in the division of a wild card team. The question is in both scenarios, where do we go from here? Little cap room next year, several free agents and holes that would need to be filled. Maybe bring up some young blood from Providence to help fill out the squad and take another crack at it with some youth throughout the roster.

If that is the last we see of Bergy and Krejci, I’m just depressed. Similar to Brady’s last game, just a deflating loss to end such a story on.

I don’t agree with much that Netanyahu does but let’s not infantilize the Palestinian population. They waged war with Israeli neighbors in 1948 and lost, there were other Arabs who didn’t and now live peacefully in Israel (20% of the population). They tried going into Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt and a quick google search will show you a history of successful assassination attempts to royalty and prime ministers, gun smuggling, and attempted overthrowing of governments that all halted peace talks with Israel and led them to be expelled from those countries. From there we can go to the early 2000s to the first two intifadas with the weekly suicide bombings of public transportation in Israel. Then Hamas was elected the leading party of Gaza with a charter that specifically stated a goal of murdering all Jews and taking all of Israel for themselves. 

Fast forward to October 7th, can you really defend the actions of that day? What happened at the Nova Festival and Kibbutzes all along the border?

fsuy469,"I’ve seen a lot of this dumb shit myself. The issue is that 1) people post quick opinions to social media and shut down discussion by spreading this shit like wildfire. Suddenly the sentiment went from a well formed thought to the public being unable to back up aggressive opinions. Humanity often chooses low-effort big impact ideas (see: our stupidassed President). 2) A lot of people posting these sentiments have never experienced violent or high level felonious crime in their lives. I moved to a relatively large city once where two people got shot the whole year and it made headlines all week. The same friends are regurgitating these opinions because they cannot understand the need for policing on this level. I also lived in a place that did not have a police force, only community volunteers. But the town had less than 1000 people and everyone had a gun so I never saw a single crime happen. Cut to Chicago, where crime is a system fed by corruption so deep that a couple of days of having cops stand down led to, well, this. 

That said, reformation is important. The police force needs to be separated out, cops should only be showing up to 911 calls. 
* No traffic, no suicidal calls, no crime scene investigation. The more variety we give them, the more corruption can spread, and for those not spreading it, the more exhausted they are. If a cop spends all day getting shit thrown at him in one area and then gets put on ticket duty for the night, guess who’s going to be jumpy, jaded, and more likely to be be a bitch? Cops are humans, and humans have emotions. 
* So we reduce their touches with the community a bad light while increasing their non-violent community involvement: forums. Publicly attended with community advocates from all districts. I want people living in Gold Coast to be forced into the forum with people from west side, etc. You shouldn’t be living in Chi and be allowed to ignore what’s going on. It wouldn’t be bad to actually hire advocates whose job it is to listen over PD radio so they can take specific notes to address and bring to light. The media doesn’t cover shit in Chi so we should have a direct line to internal PD. 
* Chi has been extremely lenient on criminals for a long time, and it does not work. We have a 10% murder clearance rate and it is almost entirely between POC. You cannot force someone into rehab or mental health. You can provide them resources and increase mental health resources within jails. It has to change from being a temporary punishment to being a permanent solution for both the people jailed, and the people harmed. It’s a fine line, a complex issue, and it needs to be talked about rather than just being some virtue signal by people who have never come close to the issue.

* Edit to add one more point: cops need to be fired for far fewer infractions. I’m taking minor infractions. If it’s enough to be on record as a cop, it’s a strike. This is a JOB. Cops can be replaced. If we give police fewer responsibilities and create non-violent jobs such as mental health emergency personal (suicides, homeless folks, etc) and crime scene investigation (which is now done almost entirely by police) then we lower the pressure to keep a trained bad cop on the force, lower the chances that they’ll stack up infractions (by way of increasing cop mental health), and increase jobs for civilians.",comment,Chicago,0

ct6qd92,"its just strange. I have problems with police brutality.  the fellow who was shot in the back for running.  Tamir Rice... Freddie Gray.. there is a CLEAR problem with many cops and black people.

i just dont get this line of logical thinking where because some people have been abused by cops (or.. you know.. people.. people abuse eachother all the time.. the domestic violence numbers speak clearly. and they arent cops) it means every instance is abuse by police.

I actually care about the problem of Police Brutality and racism, but I really feel like people trivialize the truth and facts of the case to fit their narrative.  I will gladly admit if this is proven a murder, but YOU DON'T START WITH a large conspiracy to murder someone and cover it up.. especially when there is a clear history of suicide in jail, and people being PUSHED to their last breaking point.  I've attempted suicide myself.   It's not surprising why people make quick irrational emotional decisions.

MY WHOLE POINT, is that i support the fight against police brutality, but I also think its important not to trivialize every interaction with police as some intentional killing. 

I am the last person to want to defend cops.  I have so many problems with them. i've had a history of them.. but when i start projecting MY history on to cops that have nothing to do with me, than i am making a huge mistake.  I'm messing up the effectiveness of my cause and diluting its message by just ASSUMING the worst every time.

there is a problem of black people being chased down and shot, etc..  the best way to deal with that issue is to be factual and not use broad generalizations for every instance.  

If this comes out to be a suicide as it has been said, you will still have people saying it was a cover up, etc.. There is really no way to have a rational discussion with people who dont appreciate rationality.

the way racists talk about black people, sounds an awful lot like how activists talk about white people.  its just two sides of a nasty coin.  i wish people would learn to have disucssiosn and WANT TO convince their opponent through reason and logic.  I dont know why shaming is supposed to be considered an effective method of progress.

df48na,"What is going on with cps? 

Why do they perform so poorly relative to the rest of the nation, the pay of the teachers and so on.  I know this is a hot topic, so I’m prepared to sift through the contempt and trolling about to come down upon me for some kind of lead to an answer.   Every time I talk to some one about it, it’s pure cynicism and/or denial. So, in an act of radical faith, here goes:

From what I have been able to surmise so far is that everybody wants better education but the unions can only strike over pay— thus even though their intentions are good, they only have a hammer to fix their screwed up education (pardon the pun).  They have been able to use this to shake down the city and have grown used to it— when that’s pointed out they state their intentions to better performance (classroom sizes, more social workers, etc). And the cycle continues.  The city and state have no bargaining power and both are pretty much broke. They could tax more progressively, but that would seem to be suicide without property tax reform.  The real wages of teachers seem to be growing higher than the private as it is, along with benefits and pension.   The result is resentment of public workers.  My concern is about the pipeline of private interest and union interest to keep.  Keeping this immovable issue alive means the worst of both sides rise up through the pipeline of leaders.  Due to crazy people having nothing better to do than have fits trying to solve and unsolvable issues (not they are in totally good faith there but their warped mind doesn’t care to see the opportunity cost of spewing the same party line bull shit , think Jeanne Ives). The unions allied with a money of the tax lawyers have their pipeline and local business allied with pro-business republicans (often in more suburban or rural areas) have their pipeline growing political leaders who have no intention of compromising.  

 But the original question is about performance, why is the performance of the schools, particularly in Chicago, still so bad?  Is that the pipeline is too contaminated for the unions need to put down the hammer and pick up some other tool? Article after article paints a painful picture but no real insight. I think the story I have told this far is too simplistic, or worse, misleading. It’s all I got right now so I’m looking to open it up to some thoughts from other people.",submission,Chicago,0

g7g3h9p,"&gt; Citizens are being asked to approve the greatest city debt and tax increase in Austin’s history during the worst economic and health crisis for generations. In a city where only a handful of citizens use public transit, Project Connect’s light rail would serve less than 1% of regional mobility with no discernible positive impact on congestion or climate. We are told “we must do something,” but doing the wrong thing is worse than doing nothing — Project Connect is a very destructive, wrong thing.    
&gt;  
&gt;Prop A reads like a sales brochure, concealing the massive, long-term cost for all Austin citizens. Many incorrectly assume Prop A fully funds Project Connect; It won’t even pay the annual operations and maintenance cost. Using Capital Metro’s numbers and traditional bond funding, Project Connect requires $2,800 a year at minimum on the average property value to fully fund and operate.     
&gt;  
&gt;Project Connect is based on uncommitted and doubtful federal funding. Austin intends to collect the tax increase regardless. Lack of federal funding almost doubles the local tax cost.  
&gt;  
&gt;Passing Prop A increases city tax 25% — over $500 annually on the average valued property. It is a tax rate increase. Unlike a bond, its cost rises with yearly appraisals, compounds future tax increases and is perpetual. Light rail wouldn’t run for a decade, or more, but this record tax increase starts this year.    
&gt;  
&gt;Imposing extraordinary debt and taxes, as so many struggle to survive and businesses face bankruptcy, indicates city leaders are insensitive and out of touch. The economy is shaky and could slide into a depression. It is not the time for oppressive, ineffective tax increases.     
&gt;  
&gt;Project Connect doubles-down on outdated technology in the midst of a technological mobility revolution.  Austin is a progressive, tech-forward community, why go “all in” on a system that would be obsolete before complete?  
&gt;  
&gt;Over 80% of the cost is centralized, fixed light rail. With the exception of those living near, accessing the train is problematic and time consuming. It’s more practical to drive to your destination. Few people will trade convenience, safety and utility of a personal vehicle for the lost time and inconvenience of public transit. For these reasons, U.S. public transit has declined for several years. Austin’s 2019 transit ridership was less than 30 years ago; after spending about $8 billion in today’s dollars and after the population doubled.     
&gt;  
&gt;Politics and money provide toxic transit policy. Project Connect “connects” rail corporate interests and developers to a taxpayer funded “gravy train” worth billions. The millions spent on advertising and proponent PACs confirm this. Follow the money.     
&gt;  
&gt;The pandemic proves riders avoid risky public transit; science confirms it is prudent. Why invest in a system so vulnerable? Work-from-home expansion is permanently reducing commute demand Project Connect hopes to serve. We don’t know the pandemic’s exact impact on public transit, shouldn’t we see how it settles, before taking irreversible risks and committing the future of several generations?   
&gt;  
&gt;Austin’s work-at-home population has experienced a steady increase of some 500% in the past 20 years to about five times transit’s commuting. This has removed 10 times the number of commuting cars from roads compared to transit. Going forward, work-from-home projections are a minimum of 25%, most removing car commutes. This reduces more congestion and emissions than projected by Project Connect, and taxpayer/renter cost is zero instead of massive light rail costs resulting in continued unaffordability, gentrification and inequity impact on low income.  
&gt;  
&gt;More marketing than transportation plan, Project Connect is an obsolete concept which results in massive small business destruction, increased congestion/emissions and lane removals. Imagine digging up over a mile of downtown and construction on those major arterials for years.      
&gt;  
&gt;Media and politicians don’t pose critical questions to Project Connect. Its cost is a concealed guess — expect large overruns. Once approved, tax starts immediately, is permanent and will continue to increase.    
&gt;  
&gt;Please vote no on the obsolete and destructive Project Connect and Prop A.

Yeah, straight up ""I recognize your face, I'm going to fucking kill you if I see your face here again."" That same cop racked a shotgun while staring at me through a window while I sat in a public cafe about a week later - how did he know which cafe I was at? Oh the mysteries of life.

Unmarked police vehicles would show up outside of a house, government informants trying to sabotage the group, occasionally a ""suicide"" or someone would just go missing.

You might as well shake your head at all these people on Lime scooters in the city because you used to have a little Razor kickboard as a kid and it really wasn't practical.

BUT I really want to share one thing so that people remember. Suicide is not ""selfish"" and it's really awful to say that out loud *especially* to the surviving family members.   

My father died by suicide on Thanksgiving Day years ago. People tried so hard to be comforting but they actually said that to my brothers and I. That our dad was selfish. That will cross the minds of the family left behind when they lay awake alone at night trying to understand. It is so so hard to absorb. Losing someone to suicide is not just a death. You grieve the death of the person, but you get a double whammy by the method of the death. And people don't know what to say to you and it's awkward as hell and then you feel like you have to comfort *THEM* through *your* trauma!!  Anyways I have shared this on Reddit before and I will continue to do so. The reason is that many of the people that die by suicide were seen as extroverts with lots of friends and a life of the party type. My dad was like that. Robin Williams was like that. And tWitch was like that. We have to remember that suicide happens *because we least expect it to* and by that I mean that we often take for granted the extroverts and the people with the packed social calendars. Those people often times paint themselves into a place where they don't want to be seen as a bummer by asking for help or by sharing real feelings. So they fight by being funny and charming and fun.   
 So I just want to remind everyone that even the people that seem to *have it all* still need close and honest check-ins with people that will let them be REAL.

Be patient with folks in town, many have had a rough time during this pandemic. Be open to new experiences &amp; conversations. It can take time some to establish a friend group it seems. My experience might be unique (Portland is the only real home I've known) but being complimentary and sincere is an effective way to break the 'Portland freeze'. Ask questions and listen. Really, try to listen. Set a goal to leave anyone you interact with with a better day than before you interacted with them. It's exhausting but fulfilling for me.

Bikes are my favorite way to get around town. Be sure to lock up. A hearty u-lock or even two are prudent investments. Throw in a bonus cable lock if you're feeling sketched out by an area and I'm confident you'll have your steed ready for you when you return. There's some really fucking cool local bike shops all across town.


Don't wait in line anywhere. There's another option to get a similar experience without wasting valuable time waiting. You can always go back to that coveted spot during off hours.

Try to tip generously. Portland, until recently I suppose, has a brunch based economy. There's a lot of rad service workers that rely on tips to pay their sizable bar tabs. They generally all deserve it.


www.trimet.org is another fantastic way to navigate thru the Portland Metro area. It just takes a bit more patience &amp; understanding. Public transit time can be used to read, listen to music/podcasts or simply be present in the moment gazing out the window for gems you might not find while driving.

The parks here fuck. Visit early. Visit late. Most of all visit often. Get registered to vote. There's any number of problems with the city, voting is just one method of having your voice heard to correct some of them.

The Multnomah county libraries are rad. You can get free passes from them to visit all sorts of museums &amp; other cool shit. Impressive comic book &amp; music selection as well. Several of my favorite residents are or used to be librarians. They're some of the best (and occasionally the worst) the city has to offer.

Voodoo isn't rad (at least anymore). Seasonal depression can be a real fucking thing. I deal with it by trying to save some of my watch/read/gaming desires for winter. Value the sun while it's around (and not smokey).

Ultra rich means folks earning over a hundred million a year, who often dodge tons of tax responsibility and can lobby Congress to get heaps of financial aid.

Wealth inequality is bad for social stability, it's a drag on growth, and it creates anxiety for the poor which fosters violent crime, depression, and suicide. We could fix a lot of problems for numerous individuals with the money you'll pay due to higher Biden taxes.

I imagine you might disagree, since the system as is serves you well, but I think it's ethically suspect to grow rich off the productivity of people who sweat and work their asses off but don't get ahead.

So yes, it's good that Biden's going to raise your taxes. I like capitalism, and I like rewarding hard work and innovation, but look around at your fellow Americans. Look at how many people you could help, while still maintaining your own quality of life.",comment,Atlanta,1

Ah and the advice given by you ""seattle freeze"" advocates is... blame seattle. Good advice lmao.

Pushy and demanding assumption that people should just magically have friends because they show up? I don't even get this. It's like you believe you're entitled to people's time. 

>That's not easy for everyone, and ""have you tried getting outside your comfort zone?"" is like telling a depressed purpose ""hey have you ever tried just not being sad?""

j6yvar2,"LOL yeah, 1 instance is statistically insignificant. You know what else is statistically insignificant (and according to your reaction, humorous)? The number of annual gun deaths in the US:

There are about 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, this number is not disputed. (1)

U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)

Do the math: 0.00915% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.

Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.

What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths:

• 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)

• 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)

• 489 (2%) are accidental (5)

So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population.

Still too many? Let's look at location:

298 (5%) - St Louis, MO (6)

327 (6%) - Detroit, MI (6)

328 (6%) - Baltimore, MD (6)

764 (14%) - Chicago, IL (6)

That's over 30% of all gun crime. In just 4 cities.

This leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others

Yes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...

But what about other deaths each year?

70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)

49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)

37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)

Now it gets interesting:

250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10) You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!

610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11) Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).

A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.

Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!

268.8 million cars in the U.S. 
~40,000 fatal car accidents a year 

393 million guns in US (known about/registered. Many unregistered)
14,542 gun murders per year

Meaning:
.0148% of cars end someone’s life
.0039% of guns used in murder

There’s a 73.6% higher chance someone will be killed on accident by a car than to be killed on purpose with a gun. 

Cars aren’t designed to kill but they are over 73% more likely to kill than something that was designed to do so. 

There’s no license or permit needed to OWN a car. No one cares if you drive it on your private property (granted you have enough space to do so) you could let your 14 year old kid drive it down your driveway to pick up the mail. You do however need a license to drive it on public roads. In most states the same applies to guns. You can’t brandish or use it in public without legal ramifications, but at home you can have it on you. 

There’s no background check when buying a car or even getting a license. You can be mentally unstable, a dishonorably charged veteran, a domestic violence perpetrator, or even a felon/ex-con. With guns there is a background check. 

Political leanings, personal feelings, judging of morality, and emotional arguments aside— what should we statistically be more concerned about?
—————

We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.

Here are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well.

https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#14

Page 15:

Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010).

That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including the suicides.

Older study, 1995:

https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6853&amp;context=jclc

Page 164

The most technically sound estimates presented in Table 2 are those based on the shorter one-year recall period that rely on Rs' first-hand accounts of their own experiences (person-based estimates). These estimates appear in the first two columns. They indicate that each year in the U.S. there are about 2.2 to 2.5 million DGUs of all types by civilians against humans, with about 1.5 to 1.9 million of the incidents involving use of handguns.

r/dgu is a great sub to pay attention to, when you want to know whether or not someone is defensively using a gun

jy5p4n4,"“Humans have so disrupted natural systems that we’ve left endangered animals clinging to existence on shrinking islands of habitat,” said Wiston Vickers, a veterinarian at the UC Davis Wildlife Health Center.

That’s what it all comes down to, ultimately. It’s depressing and pretty hopeless, because the majority of people are never going to settle for less, and the environment has been so irreversibly damaged at this point, it’s only going to get worse, everywhere.

“Then we try to fix things as best we can in often imperfect ways.”

I understand that this was complicated to deal with and there were competing interests, but I do think that this outcome was a no-brainer and that this decision and the actions afterwards indicate some pretty significant levels of incompetence. Relocating wild animals, especially predators, is rarely successful. All big cats, regardless of sex, are extremely territorial, their lives depend on it. Those cougars would have tried to get home, regardless of any ‘mates’, simply because that was their home. What a horribly cruel thing to do. If the local predator to prey species ecology was simply not sustainable, euthanasia would actually have been more humane. Maybe they really just wanted to believe they had a decent chance, I don’t know.

I do wonder, if there was already knowledge that the big horn population was not large and secure enough to support additional cougars, why not sterilize existing local cougars, instead letting their numbers grow and then risk killing them?

ca3hh0k,"Lived in Seattle for almost a decade, after living on the East Coast. 

1. You're in luck - can't answer for the community feel, but Seattle is very much a ""yoga town"". 

2. Many Seattle neighborhoods are great for walking around - Queen Anne, Ballard, Downtown, U. District, Capitol Hill, etc. You can start downtown, pick a direction, and start walking. On a beautiful summer day (and the summer days are long, due to location), there is nothing better. 

3. You'll notice a difference between transplants and people originally from Seattle .. especially coming from Boston. I (and many other transplants) found it very hard to make good friends with people originally from Seattle. People were polite, helpful if asked, but yes, quite reserved. I am not from the US originally, had lived on the East Coast first and it was a big shock. My husband, who's an American from LA, was just as surprised, so it's not just an ""immigrant"" thing ..  That being said, I am sure that you can meet people who share your interests and start there - and there are so many ""transplants"" you're bound to overcome the Seattle freeze if you encounter it. 

4. Seattle is a fantastic food/drink town - you'll have so many options. Healthy, organic food is big - and vegetarian food is delicious there. 

5. Since i only visited Boston many times, i can't answer this question. To end, i'd recommend getting a ""sun lamp"" and taking some vitamin D. East Coast winters are awful in comparison, but the long periods of overcast skies (it's not the rain, it's the _extended_ lack of sun..) can get really depressing.

juys5vv,"Good Samaritan here. OP leaving out some very important details of our phone conversation here...

1. I asked if the cat was micro-chipped. He didn't answer and instead deflected the question saying ""Just give me my cat back""
2. I asked where he got the cat and from who. All he kept repeating over and over was ""from a friend for cash"". I asked OP if I could have this friends contact information and if they were a breeder or something so I could contact just to verify  - OP would not answer my questions and refused to give me his ""friends"" contact info as to where he got the cat. Red alarm bells for me here. 
3. OP stated they have had the cat for only 7 days. 

At this point my red-alarms were going off.  Just look at the adorable cat - I just could not risk anything ever happening to this sweet, innocent animal, nor it going to the wrong owner.  

3. Let's remember folks, OP allowed a kitten of 5-6 weeks old to fall out of a 2nd story window. 

4. I told OP that unless he can answer my questions and provide me proof that the cat is his, I'll just bring it to SFACC down on Bryant street, and he can get it back from them. (I called and spoke with Toni of Toni cat rescues SF and also the shelter to ensure no harm would come to the cat prior to bringing it there; also informed them it has an owner and gave them OP's phone number). 

5. This kitten is 5 weeks old. Kittens should remain with their mothers for much longer, usually 12 weeks. Wherever OP got this cat, it was not from a place of reputation nor a place that cares about well-being of animals.  Again, this caused major alarm bells.

6. **HERE'S THE BEST PART -** for those of you telling OP to contact SFPD lol. When I informed OP that I was going to bring the kitten to SFACC, he said to me ""I will fucking find you, track you down, and fucking kill you."" Then hung up on me. See a screenshot of our chat where he made a 2nd death threat against me.  Immediately after our call I called SFPD and have filed a report agaisnt this individual - they have this individuals name, address, etc. and will be following up accordingly. 

7. OP during our call guilt tripped me by saying ""I am suicidal and I got this cat to help with my depression."" Again, red alarm bells. Not ok  - while I sympathize with your feelings and situation OP as someone who has depression as well, you got this animal to help you - you need to look after its best interests - you don't bring a helpless, defenseless creature into a situation that could be harmful to it. Get help and medication, then get a cat. 

I've worked in foster care and shelters for cats - none of what happened today is ok, and I encourage redditors who commented on things and reacted to maybe slow down and realize than an OP might be leaving out some crucial facts. 

**OP, your cat is at SFACC down on Bryant St. Deal with them, and stop inciting people on reddit, and for the love of god stop with the death threats.**

ludg8gx,"I feel like this deserves a follow-up post because you've had me thinking about it all night, and I really want to try to explain to you (and anyone else who might be reading) why this is transphobic.

Do you question all your friends about the healthcare they decide to do? I mean female oral birth control has been linked to cancer, do you tell all your cis-female friends they shouldn't take it because of that? What about elective plastic surgery. Do you tell your cis-gendered friends they shouldn't do elective plastic surgery? What about cis-women who take hormones when they enter menopause? Would you question that? Okay, maybe you're saying they are adults, they can make their own choices.

What if your friend tells you their cis-child at age eight entering precocious puberty and the doctor has recommended puberty blockers to get their child through puberty at a later date. Would you question them on this decision? Or is it just trans kids on puberty blockers you don't like? 

What if your friend's kid was going through cancer and they had to get chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Would you tell them not to do it because these therapies may damage the immune system or growth of their child later? And before you say it's different because this is a life or death situation, I want to point you to this article (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32345113/) that points out that 82% of transgender youth have thought about suicide and 40% have attempted suicide. A lot of this is based on being unloved by society and the feeling of being somehow wrong. You honestly think that denying kids medical care to alleviate these statistics is the right choice? 

And it's not as if a child telling their parents they think they are trans means that the parents can just run down to a Walgreens and pick up over-the-counter hormones and just start injecting their kids with it that day. It requires months-to-years of psychological examinations and working in conjunction with medical doctors to even prescribe something like that for trans kids. Do you honestly think the process would be easier for kids? Trans adults are fighting for their rights to have access to medication, and you come on here and think parents can just give it to their kids willy-nilly?

But ultimately, why do you have the audacity to tell anyone how they should live their lives and have medical care, questioning decisions that are made with their doctors and psychologists? And if you still think you do, I hope you aren't just questioning trans care, because if you are, then you are transphobic. 

But to also follow up on another point, the phrase ""effeminate boys"" (even though I used it in my previous reply) really irked me because it somehow implies it's wrong. Just the phrase. Whatever behaviors that are ""recognized"" as belonging to women or men are only there because society has decided how women and men should act and behave. You running around screaming tomboys and effeminate men is just perpetuating this stereotype that you seem to be so against, but yet you continue to use gendered languages to point out how wrong and different it is to act this way compared to other boys and girls. Just a thought on how you, who claims to not be transphobic and a great ally, could really work on how to improve your allyship, if that's what you are actually trying to do.",comment,SanFrancisco,1

f1l6uua,"I use ""we"" to refer to everyone else who works with these clients in the same capacity as I do. 

I think you are identifying a gap in the system that has been notoriously hard to close. Historically, someone's family member would be that contact person for medical professionals. Most of my clients have **me** listed as their emergency contact because they have nobody else that they could call. I think that this is why ER usage has become the top priority for DHS (the primary funding source for my agency), and my supervisors are always on me and my colleagues to stay ahead of the clients' health issues and try to take them to their primary care doctors before they end up in the ER. Overdose falls into a different category in terms of best practice for prevention. I am thinking of clients who end up in the ER for things like infection, diabetic emergency, and other chronic health conditions. Even where I work...  after giving someone Narcan they just up and run. 

&gt;I need a quick way to contact someone who can come in and see if they'll agree to in-patient placement.

I'm going to think on this more. How can I ensure that an ER nurse would know to contact me if one of my clients does a bunch of meth and PCP and disappears for a few days, only to return and report that they were in the hospital..... I wish I knew. Best idea that I have right now is to call hospitals ahead of time, with the client's consent, and list myself as an emergency contact on their medical file (is that even a thing?). I certainly cannot agree to in-patient placement if my client is laying there and clearly declining and preparing to leave AMA. I can only initiate involuntary hold for suicidality/homicidality and it's hard to argue that shooting up is suicidal behavior. Constant 5150 or 5250 is not the solution.

&gt; it only works if they give us their real name

IME, this is a political issue and clients give fake names because they have been denied access to medical insurance or medical care because they are undocumented. They give the name of someone that they know has insurance.

To answer your second question, we don't categorize behavior as compliant or not. We use a harm reduction model. I have had conversations that go something like, ""Okay, you gotta shoot up. But how about we go to the needle exchange first and then you agree to shoot up in your tent instead of on the corner so that at least you don't also get arrested. Oh, and here is some Narcan just in case you OD.""

Motivational interviewing is the best tactic for changing behavior, but you don't have time to sit down and ask a million open-ended questions just to get a client to stay in the hospital.",comment,LosAngeles,1

If you are in urgent need of mental health care in the SFV, you can go to Olive View Mental Health Urgent Care. This is a county facility in Sylmar down the road from the actual county hospital. You can get same day treatment there if you are suicidal, go tomorrow as a walk in.

Northeast Valley Health Corporation in Van Nuys, 6551 Van Nuys Blvd, Bank of America building, offers homeless medical, dental and mental health care if you are MediCal eligible. Across the street is Hope of the Valley, where you can have breakfast and lunch and shower. You can use their or NEVHC’s address as your own for getting mail and, presumably, as an address for getting a job.

You may qualify for general relief (a few hundred bucks per month) if you are unemployed, and there is a separate office for food stamps. I believe both offices are in Van Nuys. If you go to Hope of the Valley tomorrow they can probably give you more specifics on location. NEVHC providers will sign off on your general relief.

Contact info for Hope of the Valley..

- LGBT Youth Center


- The Salvation Army The way In


- Covenant House



These are all for kids 24 and under and they're all LGBT friendly. However, they probably have long waitlists as well so I'd recommend joining the waitlist ASAP. Meanwhile you could either go to a hospital and let them know you're suicidal so that they let you stay there for one night [technically they're supposed to keep you for 3 but they never allowed me more than one night]. If that's not an option I recommend going to the West Hollywood Library [I recommend this one in specific because they won't kick you out, others will] and sleeping there during the day, and during the night just taking the number 4 bus from Downtown to Santa Monica back and forth to pass the time as its relatively safe [just sit close to the driver. Don't fall asleep or someone will pickpocket you].



I was homeless for a few years in LA. Those are the tips that come to mind right now but I for sure know more stuff, DM me if you have any other questions.

I noticed a few mental health related posts here lately.  Figured I'd drop a few resources and some info about them.  This isn't a full list, but it's a start.  At the bottom are tips on how to find someone in private practice.

Community Mental Health (Usually takes Medicaid, and also access to psychiatrists/prescribers/ARNPs)

1.  Valley Cities (Several Locations)

2.  Compass Health (Several Locations in King and Snohomish County).  Compass Health has a wraparound service called WISE that is great for youth/teens who need additional support.  I used to bash Compass, now I like them a lot.

3.  Sound Mental Health (Several locations - has a kinda ehhhhh reputation).

4.  SeaMar (Several locations)

5.  The Everett Clinic (Snohomish County): Has a good DBT Group for kids.  Does NOT accept Medicaid.

6.  Mosaic Children's Therapy (Northgate)

7.  Associated Behavioral Health (Northgate)

8.  Puget Sound Psychotherapy (Madison Park): Group practice with private practice counselors.  (Unsure if Medicaid accepted).

9.  Mindful Therapy Group Seattle

10.  Seattle Counseling Services (LGBT)

11.  Catholic Community Services (Has a dual diagnosis program for youth in some locations).

12.  Community Psychiatric Clinic (Substance use and mental health).

13.  Center for Human Services (Youth, Family, School Based.  TREMENDOUS REPUTATION).

East Side:

1.  Youth Eastside Services

2.  Mercer Island Youth and Family Services (Mercer Island Residents Only)

3.  Wellspring Bellevue 

4.  Thira Health

5.  Friends of Youth

Sliding Scale or Low/No Cost Therapy:

1.  Seattle Psychotherapy Cooperative

2. Bastyr Counseling

Intensive Outpatient or Partial Hospitalization:

1.  Swedish Edmonds IOP

2. Fairfax Kirkland IOP (youth and adult)

3. Smokey Point Behavioral Hospital (youth and adult)

4. Thira Health (DBT Group Bellevue)

5. Everett Clinic (DBT group)

Inpatient (For crisis situations.  Go to ER in emergency and assessment).

1.  Harborview (adults only.  Usually very acute)

2.  Cascade Behavioral Health (poor reputation).

3.  Fairfax Hospital (For Profit Hospital)

4.  Smokey Point Behavioral Hospital (For Profit Hospital)

5.  Mary Bridge (Tacoma - Youth only)

6.  Seattle Children's (Youth only)

7.  Tacoma General

8.  NAVOS

9.  Schick Shadel (Substance Abuse).

10.  Lakeside Milam (Substance Abuse Detox inpatient and outpatient.  Burien Location has Outpatient services for adolescents).  

Note:  These are locked facilities.  If you go to these voluntarily, you are agreeing to take medications as prescribed on time daily, attend daily groups, participate in treatment, and behave appropriately.  You will be there, depending on insurance, at least 3 days, but average short term crisis inpatient stay is 7 to 10 days.  Parents can utilize PIT (Parent Initiated Treatment) if the child does not want to go and they are under 18.  Involuntary treatment is only begun by a DMHP (Designated Mental Health Practioner) of the county.  

Finding a private practice therapist:

-  I recommend trying to find a private practice therapist.  They're specialized and often well-trained.  They're also able to provide a lot more one on one care and meet a lot more regularly then at a community mental health facility.  A case load for a private practice therapist tops out at 24 to 30 clients.  Whereas community mental health will give a case load of 80 - 100 clients, thus wait times between sessions can be weeks.
- You'll often find a good therapist by talking to friends/coworkers if you're comfortable.  Use the words of others instead of YELP or Google Reviews.
-  Use www.psychologytoday.com  where you can input your zipcode and find a therapist based on several search critera like specialty, style, training, etc.  You can also use this to find a psychiatrist.
-  Insurance:  Some therapy (like couples therapy) is not covered by insurance.  Some private practice therapists won't accept any insurance, or will offer to do a super bill for out of network billing.  There are several reasons for this.  This is how I operate to be honest and transparent.  Submitting claims to insurance would require giving you a diagnosis, and diagnoses follow you.  Some therapists don't want a diagnosis to follow you.
-  There are other counseling methods other than DBT/CBT.  Try them out.
-  Bias here - but I'd avoid life coaches
- Contact therapists or your PCP for recommendations.  Therapists talk to each other.  If the one you contact is not a good fit for you, ask the therapist who they recommend.

jnhjzyo,"I’m done with this so I’m going to  speak about my experience.  I’m a cis woman / biological female. I’m an ally of lgbtqia / vote democratic.  My mother came out to me as lesbian in the 90s when it wasn’t favorably looked upon.  22 years later she came out to me as wanting to be a man so male to female / transmale.  I wanted to be supportive and figure out what that meant in terms of trans rights and problems faced in 2022.  So I researched a paper at the college level.  Focusing on bathroom issues, medical, and athletic.  My mother was an alcoholic, suffered depression and eventually I lost her to suicide and I was the one that found her.  I use her as we were mid transition and I use mother to designate the role she had in my life.   I am sad that I lost my mother and I shudder at all the hate that the trans community is facing in 2023 at it’s boiling point.  

The things I have learned: I used to work for medical insurance in WA.  It was necessary in the medical policy for trans people to live as the role of their selected gender for a year and receive counseling while undergoing hormone therapy.  I wish this was the requirement in NC as the doctor just prescribed testosterone for my mother without requiring any check ins or counseling or living as her selected gender for an amount of times.  I believe this lead to and contributed amongst many factors in her suicide.  

I can’t argue against Desantis requiring trans people and adults to go in person and follow up with their care.  

In my research paper I found out there are not enough scientific studies of trans athletes at the Olympic and professional level ruling out their strength as biological men transitioning over biological females. I used swimming and Leah as an example for my paper.  She only in the last 15 years would have been in the top 4 of women who won.  For example Katy ladecky still bested Leah’s times. The trans woman from New Zealand who did Olympic weight lifting was bested by a 20 something Chinese woman who took the medal.  
There just didn’t enough established evidence yet.  However in my opinion - if you are a trans woman in your 20 to 50 just now receiving hormone therapy you shouldn’t be competing against biological women.  You’ve already developed a biological male structure.  I tried to argue for a pro trans position in my paper I really wanted too but since that paper I have established my own views.  What is needed is a full body of trans friendly or trans doctors and medical society to write medical policy and do studies which are severely lacking for the trans community.  There needs to be a - better way - to target children who are suicidal and better medical science and understanding of the children who really need hormone therapy who won’t suffer detransitioning and regrets/ damage their body.  There is no good medical science for these kids yet and I do believe it is reckless to push children into getting hormone therapy. There is the AMA nationally who regulates doctors and best medical practice and doctors licensing boards.  I don’t think it’s best policy to just loosely Goosey perceive hormone blockers to teens and kids like my mom that just had free access to testosterone because she wanted it. 

Then I saw the cover of Glamour from the UK about a trans male being pregnant. I’m done.  If you want to live as a man I won’t out you.  If you want me to use pronouns fine.  If you want to share my public bathroom fine.  If the proper medical science were in place to give hormones to the right kids who really need it with discretion for safety aka like they really want to swap genders and understand then they want to compete in women’s sports because they have been on hormone blockers and not developed the male biological dense muscles and skeletal system then fine.  

But that is a biological woman having a baby. 

So I’ve reached the crux and problem of being an ally.  
Where I kind of have to agree with the opposition.  

If you have developed a male skeletal system you don’t belong in women’s sports 

I have never wanted to down or hurt a trans woman as not being a real woman because to define womanhood is dangerous - to the women who are sterile or choose be a bit more tomboy are also not less woman.  To the women who don’t live up to crazy beauty standards or don’t wear dresses we are not less woman.  I really wanted to believe that trans women are women.  The problem is that not all trans have bottom surgery.  


So it gets messy here:

Trans women don’t have periods.  Biological women do.

Trans men are biological women having babies.

If you have a penis still you don’t belong in nude spaces like this that are for biological women.

And you know what I still can’t be on the crazy train without addressing these last concerns and say NOTHING.  I can’t be like oh yah I’m pro trans 150% of the way.  There are some major fucking issues that I have to put a foot on the ground and push back.

I still can’t figure out why so many men want to be women but less women want to be dudes.  Women already have had to fight for the rights we have.  The point of them being impeded on by transwomen has been mentioned in the media.  Would men feel the same way if there were more trans males f to m running to use male spaces ????

Editing for conclusion of my opinion only:


IF you were young enough to receive hormone therapy and not develop a male biological system sure go into the full nude.  

If you had bottom surgery fine come into women’s spaces.

If you have a penis still in a full nude place stay out.

h8ptsfq,"Some years ago, a neighbor asked me why I was ""provocatively"" flying a pride flag on my porch (right next to an American flag). I looked him right in the eye and  told him that fifteen years earlier, I had  gotten a letter addressed to ""Pride flag"" at my address. It was from a young man who said that he was considering suicide because he felt completely alone, and though he wasn't out, he felt that everyone - even his parents - hated him   because they hate all homosexuals.   He said that seeing that pride flag, and knowing that he wasn't all alone, gave him the courage to keep going. (I'm not crying - you're crying). 

Paint that fucken flag! f I could, I'd buy you a bigger barn so you could paint a bigger flag.  I'd say ""bless you"" but I'm atheist, so I'll just say thank you on behalf of myself and any young LGBTQ folks who take heart from seeing your awesome flag painting.

kiuqu0y,"Concert at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Something about watching people drink, smoke, and dance on others graves is a bit off.

Scientology reading. I would be careful on this one but you can do an e-meter reading at no cost to you and experience the fucked up world these people are in.

Magic Castle is a super interesting one in that I don’t know of many secret societies that cater to world renowned magicians where you can witness some of the most impressive magic tricks in person, while drinking and hanging out.

Soho House Malibu is a bit of a surreal experience you’d expect to be seen on TV/film with a lot of flashy people, a lot of money, and just a very LA like vibe. It’s exclusive but also pretentious and you feel like you’re being judged by at least someone in the room. If you can’t find a way into this one there’s also the DTLA one and WeHo which are less unique but still stuffy and high brow.

Skid Row warehouse party at 5am. It’s one thing to show up at Midnight and another to still be with the party when the sun is about to come up. It’s a very diverse and ecliptic crowd (some good, some bad), lots of drugs, and weirdness given the proximity to homeless and potential danger outside of them.

Hollywood Hills party. It’s one thing to have someone rent out a house, and another experience to literally show up at one where no one even knows who’s house it is or who’s throwing the party itself. Lots of influencers, lots of trust funds, but can be pretty exciting and unique experience overall.

Bar Sinister in Hollywood I also found to be quite a weird experience. The place has good intentions and good people but a bar based on sex kinks and predetermined expectations just wasn’t for me.

The men’s bathroom at The Abbey around 1am on Saturday or Sunday. It’s filled with horny men (and women), drugs, and basically no rules.

Go on a run through Forest Lawn Memorial. They allow it so long as you don’t disturb families and services. You can get get endorphins flowing as funeral services are in session in one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the US. Check out famous celebrity graves (Walt Disney, Michael Jackson) and famous architecture like Michelangelo, and The Hall of Crucifixion (the largest painting ever created).

There’s a few yoga spots around town that can get interesting in that stereotypical kind of way (crystals, music, touching, etc.) You kind of have to feel each place out though to find the really hardcore ones (felt like around Santa Monica definitely had the most)

Bar outside The Comedy Store at like Midnight when most headliners are wrapping up. It’s been a bit slower since Covid but on any given weekend you could smoke a cig or get a drink with people like Bobby Lee, Pauly Shore, Chris Delia (too bad he turned into a weirdo), Whitney Cummings, etc. Just a surreal experience with a lot of debauchery.

Probably stretching the term “weird” but depending on where you’re from (especially foreigners) wandering around USC on a football game is one hell of an eye opener. Rich, white kids as far as the eye can see blacking out with their old parents who are trying to relive their glory days. In terms of college football is probably the most stereotypical tailgate experience you’d find on the West Coast (has nothing on Midwest or the South)

There’s a few private room karaoke dive/shit holes in Ktown and Little Tokyo that actually let you pair up with other randoms. Like it’s people who are super into karaoke and they are looking for others to just sing with. I think Max Studio in Little Tokyo used to have this. You can just get hammered with a random and become best friends or they might hate you. Roll the dice.

Head to a Disney sing along movie at El Capitan Theater. The amount of adults with no children in there is shocking.

Probably not that unknown for locals… but there’s lot of email lists for free tickets to reality shows you can be a part of. The standard ones are Price is Right, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Americas Got Talent, Kelly Clarkson Show, Bill Maher, The Voice, etc. but there’s often some real random shit out there, I once got on Tom Greens Late Night Show pilot which never aired but it was an awesome experience.

Check out the full year calendar for the Convention Center. I wandered around outside for the Crypto Conference, E3, ComicCon, etc. it’s exactly what you’d expect. There’s also thinks like Furrycon near LAX, Drag conventions, and they used to have the Big Lewbowski Fest but Covid killed that. :(

I’m not sure if the bar is still open post Covid but the American Legion near Highland and Franklin used to be open to those who had a connection with military types. I guess it’s not weird but it’s a very specific crowd hanging out and real living their best lives. Older crowd just getting after it. Pretty cheap drinks too.

Someone mentioned Skid Row. If you also want to feel in danger. The purple line, either Wilshire Normandie or Wilshire Western post 11pm. Shit gets scary.

The classic Sunset Strip bars on the right night or event can be a real throw back. Like The Rainbow Room caught at the right moment I s like walking into a time capsule of an after show of Motley Crue. Whiskey a Go, The Viper Room, Go and the Roxy as well (albeit different clientele). If the top of the Rainbow Room is open, mingle and talk with all these people who long for the 80’s and 90’s… it’s a trip.

A few of the big video game publishers do occasional video game testing sessions for locals for marketing purposes. Riot, Activision Blizzard, EA… you wait in line with (no judging but true) some of the biggest nerds you can ever find and then you get to beta test games for a few hours and get snacks and do some market research. I don’t know how many cities this exists in.

Hollywood Blvd. is a no brainer. If you want a full spectrum of bizarre - do a bar crawl - start at Hooters (or did it close?), to Power House, to the Rusty Mullet/Cabo Cantina, Star Wars Cantina, The Burgundy Room, Tekila, Sunset and Vinyl, No Vacancy/Davey Waynes, Black Rabbit Rose. That entire group of establishments is within a 15 minute walk from one another and every single one has a completely different crowd and vibe that isn’t even well represented else where in the city.

Of course Jumbos Clown Room but honestly it is just a burlesque show after all. The weekends are what you’d expect but go on a weekday to just see some depressing regular types. The same goes for other Hollywood mainstays like Frolic Room, Power House (get a drink with Hollywood Blvd. Joker, he’s always in there), Boardners, The Woods, Burgundy Room, etc.",comment,LosAngeles,0

""MOUNT HOOD, Ore. (KOIN) -- A man who climbed to near the top of Mount Hood, where he planned to take his own life, was rescued after changing his mind.

The man had driven from Texas and made his climb to the summit on Thursday. He had no plans to descend.

Officials told KOIN 6 News the man has previously attempted suicide and called people from Mount Hood to let them know he planned to die there. 

￼

Chopper 6 is over Mt. Hood as a rescue for an injured climber is underway, July 13 2018. (KOIN)

""He ended up calling basically saying he was up there, he was going to be taking some medication,"" Sean Collison with the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office said. 

Mountain Wave Search &amp; Rescue said they were notified at 5 p.m. Thursday there was a person who needed to be rescued. The rescue had to be delayed for safety.

When rescuers eventually reached him, they found that he was uninjured but needed help getting down.

Conditions on the mountain were treacherous in the middle of the hot summer day, with rocks falling and ice melting. 

""This time of day the mountain just starts to fall apart,"" Phil Cole with the 304th rescue squadron said. ""Everything is melting, ice and rock is coming off the mountain.""

The Oregon Army National Guard sent an HH 60 Blackhawk from Salem and CH 47 Chinook Helicopter from Pendleton to assist with the rescue.

The Chinook helicopter was able to fly up to more than 11,000 feet, the pilots landing just the tail end in the snow with the front still hovering as the rescue team brought the climber on.

""Because of the angle, we had to crawl out there just to get under the rotor blades,"" Joshua Kruse with the 304th rescue squadron said. ""It's kind of surreal but you just have to trust that the pilots know what they're doing."" 

The man was put in an ambulance when the chopper landed.

h2zvyke,"False premise: Rising property values do not increase property taxes. Government increases property taxes and the value of your property only determines your share of the total.

Why do people support property tax? There’s no free lunch mainly. Texas ranks right in the middle of tax burden. Not high, not low.

The main reason people support no income tax with high property tax is because it’s beneficial when you have high income and a modest property. It’s really good for people in the meat of their careers who are saving/investing for retirement. Same premise for sales tax. If you’re a saver there’s no tax until you spend. If you’re a spender you’re paying.

It also taxes people from out of state who own property. Sales tax covers tourists. Both taxes hit the un-documented immigrants as well. All without filing once a year which is a waste of time.

Income tax won’t capture out of staters and other states have problems. For example, in Maine people have summer homes and they pay ultra low property tax on them while paying no income tax. The burden falls square on the full time residents and they are ultimately playing themselves with high taxes which means no one wants to live there. It results in depressed population and job growth.

This is a very unpopular opinion with progressives but the tax system in Texas is petty fair and that’s why Texas has created so many jobs and prosperity.",comment,Austin,0

I'm not saying ""both sides are the same"" but pretending there aren't problem people/areas is insane imo. The algorithm isn't driven by nuanced discussion tho. It's impossible to even have a discussion about it honestly. I mean I don't really give a fuck what the results are of said ""discussions"" in this subreddit, and I'm able to compartmentalize it, but it's still depressing.

d5vjgln,"I know this is all just a bunch of what ifs and such, but here's what I would do if I were able to.

Give the ones who want help, help. Easy enough.

The ones who don't want help receive no help. Food stamps get cut off, they can wait in line at whatever goodwill organization is nearest them to get meals. You want to talk about getting a different mindset? A structure? Getting in line at the correct time and waiting for that food is a tiny amount of commitment and structure, and it's kinda necessary that people eat, right? That little bit of responsibility and awareness of time may also be just enough of a push to help their mentality.

No unemployment or disability. OR be ready to pass a drug test to receive those benefits. Laws will be enforced. You will spend just enough time in jail to feel really shitty from detoxing off of whatever your DOC is. Eventually, they will get tired of THAT cycle and move on. If they are found camping, they will be asked to move. Basically, hassle the ones who don't want help until Portland DOESN'T seem like such a great place to be a junkie and/or homeless.

Edit: I know jail is an expensive long term solution. What I would like to see is the amount of money spent on medical care (not in jail) for these people who have no intention or way of paying for it. I will admit, a few times I have checked myself into the hospital just because it was wet and cold outside and I knew they had to admit me for at least a few hours. That's wasted money too. I also know people who would voluntarily place themselves on suicide watch at hospitals for the same reason. Last I checked it was 72 hours you had to stay at the hospital for a suicide claim. That's three days of medical care, including meals, meds and all the anemities that go along with it just because the weather is shitty or you are hungry.

The majority of society don't know how it can affect neuronal plasticity or the ramifications of drug use on a cellular level, but I'm sure that he knew. 

Being a doctor is highly stressful. When you look at the training that we have to go through, we make a lot of personal sacrifices in our 20s and 30s ( depending on what specialty you choose maybe the rest of your life) to focus on becoming a doctor. All those grueling board exams and the 80 work weeks during residency training wears you down. Add to that some malpractice lawsuits or patients yelling at you. It's like being in a pressure cooker and so it's common to develop anxiety issues/ depression.

&gt;**The prevalence of these crimes has risen in relation to the mass media coverage of them and the proliferation of social media sites that tend to glorify the shooters and downplay the victims, Johnston said**
&gt;
&gt;“We suggest that the media cry to cling to ‘the public’s right to know’ covers up a greedier agenda to keep eyeballs glued to screens, since they know that frightening homicides are their No. 1 ratings and advertising boosters,” she said.
&gt;
&gt;The demographic profile of mass shooters is fairly consistent, she said. Most are white, ostensibly heterosexual males, largely between the ages of 20 and 50. They tend to see themselves as “victims of injustice,” and share a belief that they have been cheated out of their rightful dominant place as white, middle-class males.
&gt;
&gt;**“Unfortunately, we find that a cross-cutting trait among many profiles of mass shooters is desire for fame,”** she said. This quest for fame among mass shooters skyrocketed since the mid-1990s “in correspondence to the emergence of widespread 24-hour news coverage on cable news programs, and the rise of the internet during the same period.”
&gt;
&gt;She cited several media contagion models, most notably one proposed by Towers et al. (2015), which found the rate of mass shootings has escalated to an average of one every 12.5 days, and one school shooting on average every 31.6 days, compared to a pre-2000 level of about three events per year. “A possibility is that news of shooting is spread through social media in addition to mass media,” she said.
&gt;
&gt;**“If the mass media and social media enthusiasts make a pact to no longer share, reproduce or retweet the names, faces, detailed histories or long-winded statements of killers, we could see a dramatic reduction in mass shootings in one to two years,” she said. “Even conservatively, if the calculations of contagion modelers are correct, we should see at least a one-third reduction in shootings if the contagion is removed.”**

This requires no laws. There is no law that says that media outlets need to report on mass shootings (or terrorist attacks) in a way that glorifies the killers. The media voluntarily started following similar guidelines in reporting on suicides, which suffer from similar social contagion effects. ",comment,Houston,0

cc8plov,"/u/lolmonger posted this the other day and it is informative on the topic.

It was in response to my acknowledging that the NYPD are forced into double actions and heavy trigger pulls (both have a steeper learner curve for shooting accuracy).

""The stupid trigger pulls are just symptomatic of a larger problem.

It's so silly - - they didn't bother training anyone properly going from the .38spl revolvers to semi-autos.

(The exception being those police officers who *know* they should train more than the department standards, and probably the ESU officers, who I would imagine don't use the wacky weapons beat cops get)

NYPD issues three 9mm guns: The totally outmodded Smith &amp;amp; Wesson 5906/46, the venerable Sig Sauer p226, and the Glock 19 - and not the full frame 17 for whatever reason.

NYPD opted instead of instituting a training regimen and having officers do reasonable amounts of testing and qualification with their lethal pistols, to ask the manufacturers of these guns to *specially destroy* the trigger pull (the weight required for the sear to be actuated and the hammer/striker to fire the gun)

The Glock has no manual safety, and instead has a trigger catch safety - a little rib in the center of the trigger that must be depressed for the trigger to go until it breaks, allowing the striker to fire the gun.

The Sig Sauer has no manual safety, but does have a wonderful de-cocker, and *normally* has a great double/single action. (in fact, the P22___ series were *designed* to have a single action, short break, short reset trigger after a consistent double action pull)


The 5906 has a stupid slide mounted manual safety and is a plain jane double/single action, the 5946 can be ordered without a manual safety, (and NYPD will require a 12 pound pull)

All of them are modified to have retardedly high trigger pulls, and the Sig is further sullied by being in Double Action Kellerman, which is a dumb proprietary of Double Action Only.

The only reason any of this is done is because NYPD couldn't invest the time and money to train people used to the action of revolvers to be responsible with semi-auto revolvers, and can't invest the time and money now to properly train its vast majority of officers on the manual of arms required to safely and effectively use semi-auto pistols.


So what do the off-duty/retired officers do?

They got pistols from Kahr  - very good, sub compact 9mm guns with a very consistent and lighter trigger pull.

And what happened? 

[Negligent discharges left and right](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/nypd-brass-cops-stop-kahr-k-9-semi-automatic-pistol-off-duty-gun-article-1.990037)


All because NYPD has the biggest case of departmental inertia ever to afflict a public safety organization, when it comes to the use of lethal force.

*edit*

There's a way out: The Beretta 92fs.

NYPD could adopt them, get rid of their current inventory of pistols, and make everyone use that.

There's a manual 'off' and 'on' safety (still slide mounted, oh well - no one uses the CZ line) which is also a decocker, and it's a single action double action pistol, so an officer would, on drawing a gun, have to turn the safety off, and then deal with a hefty double action pull, and then fire in single action from reset. 

This would allow NYPD to continue to have poor training, but also put at least two mechanical sources of impedance between an officer's finger and shooting something.

e2ct0c3,"I will push back a little bit on this, as I work in this world. Obviously there is a long way to go, but I will credit the NYPD in working hard to train their officers to recognize and de-escalate situations with “emotionally disturbed persons.” There are also police especially assigned to support situations involving the homeless, and I have been taken aback by the compassion I have witnessed in several situations.  Our prisons and jails still serve as the defacto mental health treatment location for way too many people, but I am working with two programs to divert people with mental health issues who are arrested from prosecution to treatment.

[NYC Well](https://nycwell.cityofnewyork.us/en/) definitely has its issues as well but I think its services are really great at addressing the time lag and gatekeeper issue for accessing mental health services. 

The city has a number of [“mental health respite centers”](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/nyregion/new-york-mental-health-hospitals.html)  which are meant as short term refuges for people needing a break but who are not dangerous to themselves or others, and an alternative to hospitalization. They are actually really nice! They remind me a bit of a monastery i their aesthetics. 

There are also a number of programs that train “peer” neighborhood or church/faith-based community members to recognize, discuss and refer people with mental health issues to various care options. (Many people seek out religious solutions to their mental illness, even if the eschew healthcare.)

Another factor to consider is the civil rights of people with mental health issues. In the past “problematic” people could be locked away for an indefinite period of time, against their will. These were basically warehouses where abuse was rampant. 


[I volunteered for a time at a nursing home and I will never forget the woman I met who was maybe 65 or 70 and had mild developmental disabilities. She had been institutionalized since age 11 or so. I almost cried thinking of more than half a century of cafeteria meals, hospital beds and zero control over her own life. Her greatest desire In life was a pet cat but she wasn’t allowed. She would have been perfectly fine living with a family member or in group home and was perfectly capable of holding a job suited to her capabilities. ]

Additionally, unlike the popular conception, most suicides are impulsive acts. [According to The New England Journal of Medicine. 24% of those who made near-lethal suicide attempts decided to kill themselves less than five minutes before the attempt, and 70% made the decision within an hour of the attempt.](http://www.businessinsider.com/many-suicides-are-based-on-an-impulsive-decision-2014-8) , 

My point is that the mental health treatment community is trying hard to improve the system. I don’t think we will ever be able to stop all suicides or attempts, due to the way impulsive nature of the act. And certainly we have a long way to go.

>According to a new analysis prepared exclusively for Crain's by the Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation and the Center for Municipal Finance at the University of Chicago, the property tax bill paid by the average Chicago homeowner could rise hundreds of dollars a year as office tower owners pay less because of the depressed value of their property. Homeowners effectively would pick up a bigger share of the tax load.
>
>For instance, if the tax value of downtown office buildings drops 20% — a figure that’s substantially lower than actual reality, according to some industry experts — the bill for the typical Chicago home would rise from $5,244 to $5,424. If there's a 40% decline, the average residential bill would go up almost 10%, from $5,244 to $5,723, assuming taxing bodies don't change their gross levy, the study found.

>The new study is based on the fact that Chicago’s property tax system is a sort of zero-sum game.
>
>The city Board of Education and other taxing bodies annually ask for a set amount of taxes, the gross levy. The bill then is allocated among individual taxpayers, based on the value of their property. If one owner pays less, because the tax value of their property has dropped, other owners have to pick up the difference unless their value has dropped, too. This can change if governments reduce their levy. But in Chicago, that almost never happens, with Chicago Public Schools, in particular, raising its levy as much as is legally allowed almost every year.

>The findings underline the challenge facing Mayor Brandon Johnson, who has vowed to freeze the city’s gross annual property tax levy, but is pushing a hike in the real estate transfer tax that office owners say will put more pressure on already sinking property values.
>
>Jason Lee, senior adviser to the mayor, said in an interview that the findings are interesting, but added that property values are “volatile” and can reverse course if the right action is taken. “We’re committed to increasing the values by boosting demand for downtown offices,” Lee said.

>If downtown values slipped only 10% and everything else remained the same, the impact on the average homeowner would be relatively small, with an increase of just $43 a year, the study found. The figure is so low because, at the 10% level, most of the need for new revenues would be paid by tax increment financing districts, which comprise more than a fifth of the city’s total tax base.

>The hike in average residential bills jumps from $43 to $180 with a 20% drop in downtown commercial values, to $326 at the 30% level and $479 at 40%. Put a different way, the share of the total tax bill paid by owners of downtown commercial property if their values dropped 40% would plummet from 26.4% of the citywide bill to 17.3%. The shift of the tax load from downtown commercial to other types of real estate, primarily residential, would top $700 million a year.",comment,Chicago,0

So just treat it like COVID and stop imagining catastrophes. There's nearly 2,000,000 people in the metro area and this fire affected like, 100. You're much more likely to get into a car accident. More people die in bathtubs than in wildfires. You just kind of have to learn to live with it. 

If you're young and healthy you'll have time to get away. We can't tell people to stop throwing their cigarette butts on the ground just because of the people who can't get away. That might make people depressed and suicides would skyrocket much higher than anything a fire might do. 

You can't control whether it happens to you or not so it's best to just ignore any advice about precautions and keep living the way that makes me happy. If I have to make adjustments for wildfires that'd be really bad, so I'm trying to get discussion banned so I don't have to think about it.

I would have gone into teaching if I knew I could make a livable wage, but you can make just as much money at Costco cooking rotisserie chicken as you do as an elementary school teacher, and not have papers to grade and curriculum to plan at home unpaid. I’m pretty sure that a lot of that money goes into school boards and administration, but not in increasing wages for actually teaching children. 

I have worked with kids as a behavior therapist and as a nanny, and there are so many parents that just don’t know what to do with their kids, and instead of figuring it out and parenting, they just hand them an iPad and tell them they can do what they want if they don’t bother them. I’ve seen it across the board in many situations, in all demographics. Honestly, I feel like it’s worse with affluent families sometimes, which is why some of these kids will be ‘fine’ until preteen years where they start viewing life differently, but get depressed because of lack of drive or social skills.

lcgjevh,"I'm in a similar boat (22F as well). I moved out for a year right after my 19th birthday from East Harlem to a small pre-war apartment in Hell's Kitchen with a roommate. Rent was very cheap due to covid so I paid ~$975/month. I managed to afford this by taking out school loans and working minimum wage part-time. School is a full ride so I was seriously relying on my FAFSA refund and taking out unnecessary loans to carry me. I also had a GoFundMe campaign to move out from a mentally abusive household, so that was around 1k to help me.

It's hard man. Til this day I have no idea how I even survived that. I was constantly stressed with school, work, finances. My depression got so bad that I had to start meds and several psych hospitalizations began.

If you move out... just plan to stay out. I don't know your circumstances, but my mom was not happy to see me return lmao. She's also what my depression, etc. stem from. My mom even moved apartments after I left and was not expecting my return. When I made a post about moving out to Reddit (I deleted this sometime back in 2020-2021), everyone downvoted the fuck out of me. To be fair, it was a dumb decision and I wasn't ready. Take your time, settle in a good paying job, and create a savings plan to move.

hiht1xu,"&gt;so a Celtics win makes my day much better. While a loss makes much worse.

Definitely something we shouldn't try to normalize or shrug off. I used to go to bed **pissed off** after a Celtics' loss during the IT years, especially after a loss in the playoffs. I'd get a poor night's sleep and then wake up just as mad to start the day, which more often than not led to bad days, and those bad days can snowball into depression, binge drinking, and all kinds of other nasty shit.

Now obviously everyone who gets upset at a game isn't going to turn into a depressed alcoholic, clearly more factors are at play there than basketball, but if losing a game is affecting your mental health for the worse that's not healthy. People shouldn't be encouraged to come here ranting and raving, and I'm not saying anyone is welcoming that, or that I haven't ranted around here myself.

In the last century in the Cold War with the USSR we never depended on the USSR for the shoes we wear on our feet to the phones we have in our pockets. We do for China today.

So, I’ll speak plainly. The same country that unleashed hell on the world with a man-made virus, that was at best accidentally leaked. The same country that is sending the synthetic precursors for fentanyl to the Mexican cartels, that’s lacing illegal Percocet that kids buy on snapchat with fentanyl today, that same country in the case of a conflict is gonna do the same thing to our legal pharmaceutical supply chain when 95% of our over the counter prescriptions trace back to a supply chain in China.

And that same country is responsible for making our fighter jets, our military stockpiles, the parts required to make almost all of our military equipment depends on China. The little chips that power that little phone you’re using to record me right there, or any other part of our modern life. That requires the tiny island nation off the south coast of China called Taiwan, which China almost certainly wants to invade in the course of the next decade or two, if not sooner.

So the Declaration of Independence of our century is to declare independence from China. That’s what Thomas Jefferson would’ve signed if he was alive today. That’s what I’ll sign as your next president. Thats what we need, and in order to get serious about that I would love to onshore as much of that as we can to the US. 
But I’m not a magician. Not all of that can be done instantly with waving a magic wand and be brought to the US. And so, we have to then open up greater relationships with the likes of Japan and South Korea and India to be able to truly declare independence and cut the cord from China. 

And so after I would say, right now we have a debate between different camps of do we want onshoring to the US or do we want free trade to …, No that’s the wrong debate. We need to declare independence to China, which means we will need more onshoring and more free trade but with allies rather than with China and that’s the way I look at it, that much I know we’re gonna be able to get done if we see it with clear eyes. Great question, appreciate that.

Q: First off, what’s your stance on mental health in America right now, and if you were to be president what would you do for the mental health of the country

VR: Yeah so look, there’s some things in the very short run and there’s the deeper question. In the short run we have a wave of violent crime in this country and almost all of that is attributable to some form of mental health epidemic in this country. 

I do think there’s room to bring back psychiatric institutions, that’s a controversial position but if you want to fight violent crime in cities that would be effective in doing it. More people are sitting in prison, prison is our #1 form of mental health care in the US today. That’s messed up because when people are released they’re worse off than when they went in when it comes to their own mental health which is the original problem in the first place. 

But we gotta go deeper. What do we think accounts for that? I think what’s going on in the country right now is that we are hungry for a cause. All of us, we are starved for purpose and meaning and I get it. At a time in our national history there were things that used to fill that void. 

Faith in God. Faith in patriotism. Belief in country. Belief in self, hard work, family. These things have disappeared. And that leaves a black hole in our hearts, and when you have a black hole that runs that deep, that is when the poison fills the void. In the political setting I’m in today we might talk about wokeism, or cilmatism, covidism, globalism, or zelenskyism. We could go down the list, but on a serious note we could put the same things on the list; fentanyl, depression, anxiety, suicide. It is not a coincidence that we see the rise of these same poisons at the same time.

And I think the way we’re not gonna win is by playing whack-a-mole, one at time trying to stamp them out of existence because its gonna be something else that pops up to fill that void. The right answer is to fill that void with our own vision of, in the political realm, what does it mean to be an American? The revival of faith and family, the things that fill our sense, our hunger for purpose and meaning. We’re hungry to be part of something bigger than ourselves.

The president cant even answer what it means to be an American. So I’m not gonna be able to fix that alone as US president, but the job of the US president is to at least fill the void of national identity, and I think its gonna be the job of pastors and parents and coaches and teachers across this country to fill other parts of that void too. 

VR Closing Statement: And I want to stay here all day with y’all, I’m having a lot of fun and we’re just getting warmed up, but I’m committed to another event we’re heading to about half an hour from here so I’ll close on this question before we wrap up. 

What I will say is that we’re taught to believe that because of that state of mental health we look at our lives in modern America and we see the endless passage of time. Like we’re a bunch of two-legged higher mammals walking some geographic space we call a country doing what our iPhones tell us to do every day.

That’s not a country. The true America is a vision of what that place can be. We’re taught to believe we’re a nation in decline, and I don’t think so. I don’t think we have to be Ancient Rome. I don’t think we have to be that nation in decline. I think the truth is as a nation, like you all, our nation is really just a little young, actually.

fmfhow1,"The upside is there's at least some pent up demand once things calm down, which wasn't the case in the depression due to the bank collapse.

There's still a lot of people employed right now sitting at home and earning their paychecks.  As soon as they start can start going out again, demand will come back, and there may be a land rush to meet that demand. A lot of people just cut their spending by  staying home, and will be itching to get out.

In the depression that wasn't the case, even people with jobs were just scraping by and there was no demand to get things restarted.  Unless we see substantial inflation or banks start collapsing in numbers, I think the climb out won't be nearly as terrible or long. It's a matter of when that will happen, and how quickly that can be allowed to happen without giving the virus the upper hand.

In fact, if you've got money and were thinking of starting a business, I'd actually keep my ear to the ground. If you time it right you'll make a fortune. A lot of businesses that didn't make it will be gone and there's going to be a window of opportunity. I think this is especially true for restaurants.  People doing take out/delivery right now are opting for comfort foods. They'll be tired of that by the end. If you've got a legit good idea an time it right, you'll have your time in the sun.

If you're not looking to start a business, I'd make sure your skills are top notch and do the stereotypical brush up the resume and work on your skillset. If I'm right about pent up demand (and all indicators seem to suggest there's a good chance), you want to be first in line at the top of the list and stand out.

e3fq05a,"The only things I'll see Google Maps consistently get wrong are things like try to send you through locked gates (some of which aren't even car gates but rather pedestrian-only gates), and going from Marina Del Rey to to Santa Monica it loves to insist that you should turn left off Washington onto Abbot Kinney and then immediately turn right onto Garfield so that you can try to make an uncontrolled suicide left onto Lincoln, instead of just going up to the intersection of Washington and Lincoln (which unless you get really lucky with that left off of Garfield will probably be faster anyhow given there's a protected left at the light). For the latter I'd guess the issue is that very few people are stupid enough to go for the suicide left, while the people who are are willing to be really recklessly aggressive about making the turn, skewing the results into making it look like it's faster to make that left.

You'll hear a lot of pessimism about PSU, and Portland as a whole. Don't let that define your opinion. Yes, it is extremely rough around the edges and can be downright depressing at time, assuming you are an empathetic person. The flipside is that it attracts an unparalleled amount of people who are passionate about making a difference, and PSU is very intertwined with many heavily involved institutions. You just have to be sure that you can handle being around blatant mental illness and poverty every single day, and fentanyl being smoked probably every other day, if not every day, as well. I've rarely seen violence. The worst of it is mostly just people yelling at the people in their heads. That being said, I do think we are still probably as close as you can get to an anarchist city, but not QUITE so much as we were from 2020-22. Long story short, don't hold your breath for the cops to come to your aid after you called them.

As far as school goes, it REALLY depends on what the degree is that you're going for - especially at the undergrad level. People have told me that we have amazing business, computer science, and engineering programs, and this is blatantly reflected by the quality of their buildings, compared to the other buildings. I believe that our urban affairs and also social work schools are the next best, at least at the grad level....so I'm assuming they're well funded at the undergrad level as well (but I STRONGLY recommend checking first - talk to an advisor or counselor and ask to see the future course offering lists for the field that you're interested in. They should have a tentative list showing the next 3-4 terms.

If you aren't in a well funded program, well, then you may get frustrated with the school. I'm about to graduate with a bachelors in geography, but I've had numerous courses cancelled last second, tons of courses are offered exclusively online (which I don't do well with, at all), and the variety and number of courses being offered during any given term can be infuriating, especially if you're trying to build a class schedule around a pre-existing work schedule.

All that being said, the clout that PSU does get is almost all based off of their school of business, school of computer science, but most importantly their graduate programs. And their online programs (mostly for their business-focused ones). Here's PSU's page on usnew's website, which is the only college-ranking website that you really need to give a shit about: [https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/portland-state-3216](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/portland-state-3216)

If you're looking for a party school with a killer on-campus social life, then run for the hills. That's not to say you can't find friends and have an awesome time (I see it all the time here), but you really have to go to events, join clubs, download MeetUp.... just be proactive about it - it's not gonna come to you - and you might get really fucking depressed, especially around February when you haven't seen the sun in like 5 straight months. There are honestly a lot of really cool and often pretty unique clubs, programs, centers, and departments to get involved with (or even work at), which you absolutely should!([https://insideportlandstate.pdx.edu/2023/09/11/clubs-at-portland-state-university/](https://insideportlandstate.pdx.edu/2023/09/11/clubs-at-portland-state-university/) )

 Which reminds me - I saw someone said that PSU doesn't really have any services and programs to help poor students. That's totally not true. There are actually a lot. They just aren't well advertised, and students don't really go out of their way to find them. But there are even ones that could possibly get you a laptop if you really needed one. I even did my capstone project at a small homeless shelter that we have for PSU students (it's called The Landing). So many students don't know that they can get almost free city scooter ride, severely discounted public transit, food, and all sorts of other shit. Here's a good place to start looking (just email the address at the bottom of the page and ask them literally to just tell you about anything else that they think could be useful for you): [https://www.pdx.edu/basic-needs-hub/#:\~:text=Mission,career%20goals%2C%20and%20interpersonal%20relationships](https://www.pdx.edu/basic-needs-hub/#:~:text=Mission,career%20goals%2C%20and%20interpersonal%20relationships)

Now, if you're more concerned about fitting in as an older student (which, at 22, you are not), then PSU is a great option for you. The average student here is 27 years old. Not making that up, Google it yourself! This means that not many students live on campus, and most of us here are super focused on getting our degree and finally doing something. To be honest, you'll probably feel like a baby here lol. Here are more PSU demographics: [https://www.pdx.edu/portland-state-university-facts](https://www.pdx.edu/portland-state-university-facts)

Also, you can totally afford to live here near the campus easier than people make it seem, assuming that you're willing to have a roommate or two, which will bring what you pay for rent down around $200-$300 per month. Better yet (and this might be my best advice), look at places that are right around the soccer stadium (Providence Park). The neighborhood is called Goose Hollow. You'll find much better deals, and it still would only take you about 30 mins by foot, 20 mins by bus, or 10 mins by bike/scooter to get there. And you'll still get your city experience, but you'll be JUST far enough removed to be away from MOST of the really bad side of Portland.  Granted, you'll get more of it the closer that you are to that Fred Meyers off West Burnside & 20th. But you'll be fine as long as you're at least 3 blocks away from Burnside. You would also be within a 5-10 minute walk of Washington Park, which is part of Forest Park, which is a BEAUTIFUL forest that you can walk into right off of Burnside. I lived in Goose Hollow for 4-5 years, and that was one of my favorite things about the area. You get tired of the city sometimes. As of right now, I'm seeing 2 bedroom spots in Goose Hollow for as low as $1450-ish. I even saw one at that price that was 750sq.ft.! Prices are a lot better these days. Probably because of our city's recent reputation. But, if you're trying to live alone, then don't count on finding anything less than a 300-400sq.ft. studio for about $1000-$1100, at best, regardless of where you're looking.

Here are some housing resources that Portland can connect their students who are in dire need with: [https://www.pdx.edu/basic-needs-hub/housing-services](https://www.pdx.edu/basic-needs-hub/housing-services)

Another option worth considering is looking at the inner-east side. You can still get a decent metropolitan lifestyle if you find the right spot, but it's definitely much more important to make sure of this when looking at the eastside. Also, the eastside is the artistic/""Portlandia"" side of the city. Downtown - not so much (the PSU campus somewhat of an exception). Downtown is pretty strongly ""young trendy professional"" vibes. But there are cool, affordable spots to be found. The coolest places to eat and hangout are on the eastside, though.

Get rid of you're car, if you do move downtown. Unless you're dying to use it to get out into the mountains and to the beaches and waterfalls and all of that amazing nature around us (which is as amazing as it's hyped to be). I had a car for about 4-5 years, and it's just stressful as fuck, if you don't have designated parking. Spots on the street fill up pretty fuckin fast after 5-6pm.

As far as work goes, you could always do what I did - work warehouse shifts at UPS. Or FedEx. It's work that can break you, but that you adapt to if you can break through the initial threshold. Plus, they pay real well, and even offer college stipends, i think up to $6k. I honestly wouldn't worry a whole lot about finding a job here, so long as you're willing to work in a warehouse, or something of the sort. I lost my UPS job a few years back and found one relatively soon after at a warehouse for a paint store.

In the end, I would highly suggest visiting here for 4-5 days, if possible. If not, then just however many you can. Do it while we're in our rainy season and imagine 5-6 straight months of that. But also know that Portland is one of the most beautiful places in the country during the other months ESPECIALLY THE SPRING!! It's absolute heaven here for those 2 months or so. The whole city becomes a total flowery wonderland. The fall is beautiful too, since we're such tree-rich city.

Portland is what you make of it, unless you can't handle it's rough edges. Then you'll probably just hate it. But if you don't, then you could do a hell of a lot worse in finding a cool little city to satisfy your hunger for a metropolitan experience. Just put yourself out there and get engaged in order to find friends. I've been on both sides of that coin, so take it from me. Portland is happy to leave you soaking in the gutter if you don't put the effort in for a social life.

Good luck in whatever decisions you make!",comment,Portland,1

I completely agree, I think there physician assisted suicide should be legal. I also believe that mental health needs to be de-stigmatized and made more accessible.

But, if you drive through, chances are nothing will happen except an overwhelming sense of depression over just how bad the situation is. And, honestly, I wished more people drove through it more frequently so they can see with their own eyes what it’s like. 

Like, seriously, if I had 20 minutes with the president, near the top of my list would be to drive him through Kensington, hammer the point that it’s beyond what a municipal govt can deal with, and grill him for meaningful federal action, not just platitudes or shit that would only nibble at the margins.",comment,Philadelphia,1

It also did not ""lose the war"" by abandoning its efforts of continuing it, but through a major revolution. I also do not see that the US just lost 1.5% of its population to a war.

With all this, the economical situation in Germany was dire. You are still balling in an economy that makes you on average 40% richer than the EU economy, with significant effects going down to the medians.

iegdblc,"Lots of good advice here. I suggest you try to build a community of people that are not necessarily friends, just people you see regularly that you exchange niceties with: the deli clerk, the guy that makes the sandwiches in the back, the barista you frequent, the workers at your gym, the receptionists at your doctors' offices, the community board meeting regulars, familiar faces when you volunteer, etc. 

Even if they're not your friends and you never see them outside of their capacity, having a network like this makes a bigger impact against depression than you might expect. I've noticed a lot of transplants tend to focus a lot on activities and making friends to do these activities, and ignore the community they live with because they might not share the same interests or values. Having a ""[third place](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/09/14/third-places-as-community-builders/)"" (or several) helps maintain your mental well-being when it's hard to make plans with friends.",comment,NYC,0

&gt; I understand this is truly anecdotal but what else has changed during the same period?

I'd wonder if the general feeling of self esteem has decreased.  Do kids feel like they'll be successful adults?

Think back to elementary.  While there were groups of kids that hung out, did they avoid each other like the plague?  ""I hate that dude, but he's good at kickball, so we'll be friends at least until this game is over"".  In high school; ""Yeah, I don't want you even touching my paper.  I'll hand it to the teacher myself"".  Has that gotten worse?  There are a few people in here I wouldn't piss on if they were on fire.  I wonder if we, as a society, are more quick to put people in that category now.  Are kids getting to that point earlier?

Has the internet made it worse?  I think back to some of the stuff I've said to people online...especially back in the day (think AOL)...ugh.  While I'm 100% sure the planet would be better off without some of the people posting in this thread; I don't need to give them recommendations so we can confirm I'm right.

(the hypocrisy is partially in jest and I'm completely aware of it...)

I think the world has probably always been a depressing place.  Now we just have a lot more access to all of it.  The childish behavior is magnified with anonymity.  There is little to break the group mentality - hell, certain problematic aspects are encouraged by the nation's ""leaders"".  Now with 24x7 access.

k26e7vq,"This thread smells badly of ""Scarlet Letter"" accusations, if you know that novel. Every HW does because they read it -- along with Moby Dick and dozens of other extraordinary classics. The science program at HW is better than at some colleges. The quality of HW graduates is routinely extraordinary. By any measurement it's an astonishingly good school. So, let's tear it down without knowing much, or anything, about it. 

Some of you just hate private schools, in general. Those are worthless comments. Many private schools do a much better job than many public schools. 

Some of you ""heard"" HW was too hard, or you ""heard"" it was an overly pressurized environment, or my favorite, you didn't get into HW but you're glad you did. I didn't get into Yale, but I'm not glad of it. 

Do the facts matter? Here are a few:

1.It's very common for suicides to occur in groups, if you don't know that. One suicide, especially among young people, often inspires others. This is unfortunate, to say the least, but it's still true. 

2.Young people today -- everywhere -- seem to be under intense pressure to succeed. It's hardly a HW phenomenon by any stretch of the imagination. It's everywhere. But, sure, let's all jump on HW which is routinely considered the very best private school not just in LA, but in Calfiornia, an done of the top schools in the whole country. It smacks more than a little of resentment and jealousy. ""You know, those smart people with those great educations, I hate them"" is a pretty weak argument. 

3.Though nearly all of you assume otherwise, there is actually little to no evidence that the particular students who committed suicide did so because they were under academic pressure. That HW has academic pressure which comes from its high academic standards is clearly true. That these three young people killed themselves because of that pressure does not seem to be true. They klled themselves over personal issues which seem unrelated to academics. The father who committed suicide did so undoubtedly out of grief and perhaps out of a sense he may have pushed his child too hard. But it's hard to say. 

4.Which brings up the most important point. We live in a society which tars and feathers people regularly, often with little to no evidence. It's very common for men to be acccused of rape or sexual harassment and lost their jobs with no actual evidence they did it, and it's not unusual for the accuser to later recant their claims. It's subversive and mean-spirited. These claims about HW fall into that category. They are based on no actual knowledge of the students who died. Remember them? And it's clearly far more motivated to pull down HW than anything else. Is that out of jealousy or resentment? Because if you do that with no knowledge of what actually caused these deaths, you are pretty much a scumbag as far as I'm concerned.",comment,LosAngeles,1
jnx1zdg,"I'm in a similar situation (except for gay dating) - I make a similar salary with a remote job and similar hours, just moved here in March. Excited for you! NYC is incredible - there's a reason why it's so expensive. 

A few things:

1. Taxes are a big factor that you should consider and probably have a conversation with an accountant. Not a deterrent by any means but just an extra price to pay to live here that you should be aware of and factor in. 
2. You will be able to afford a nice place, but be prepared to prove that you have $$$ in the bank. Some apartment applications asked for proof of 40x rent in the bank (not considering your yearly salary). 
3. I would consider getting a short term place first to explore the city and figure out which neighborhood you want to live in before you sign a lease and make a big commitment. It can be hard to know which neighborhood is right for you until you're living here for a bit. 
4. As others have mentioned, working remotely here can be kind of depressing. I've also found it more difficult to make friends here than other cities I've lived in.
5. Get an equinox membership/factor that into your budget. Equinox is a place to escape your apartment, several have great spaces from which to work and wifi, provides access to bathrooms and locker storage all over the city, and much more.

2. End Councilmanic Prerogative. So much good policy gets stonewalled because of this petty bullshit.

3. Slash the PPD's budget to better fund municipal &amp; social services. Police have a definite role to play in keeping our home safe and responding to crime, so we should let them do that rather than asking them to also be social workers and allowing things like roadwork and garbage collection to atrophy.

4. Safe injection sites, supervised by trained employees who can be paid for with some of that redistributed PPD money.

I wasn't talking about the Harvard suicide study. The Harvard analysis study of the self defense study says that 100k per year is reasonable.



The data that the suicide study sites is not sufficient because they failed to do a state by state analysis. Also, correlation does not equal causation. Do you have any study that backs up your claims of higher suicide causation? You are only attempting to prove a correlation.



You are forgetting that we have the same gun ownership rate as Maine (22%). 


These cultures have higher suicide rates because they have forms of suicide that are considered ""honorable deaths""? This is ridiculous and outdated and racist. But fine I'll play along. Russia, Poland, and Belgium all have higher suicide rates than the US with far lower gun ownership rates.


You are making an absurd claim that our suicide rates would skyrocket if we loosened our gun laws. You have no data or evidence to back this up. Our gun ownership laws (not concealed carry laws) have actually gotten less strict over time. FID cards are now 'shall issue'. They used to be 'may issue'. 


Fine it peaked during the mid 90s. That is exactly when states started loosening concealed carry laws. It has been a slow progression since 1986. The majority of relaxing the carry laws was done during the mid-late 90s. 


Like I said, you are inexperienced with analyzing data. You keep focusing on single sample size stats. Now you mention Louisiana. A sample size of 1. I never said that all states with looser gun laws are safer. I said that overall when looking at ALL 50 states, it is safer to be in a place with relaxed concealed carry laws. 


It is an absurd claim that allowing gun ownership is taking away people's right to life. We are talking about government laws here. Should people be allowed to drive? Far more people get killed by cars each year than guns. That van attack in France killed like 86 people. Is allowing driving the same as taking away people's right to life? ",comment,Boston,0

Medical insurance generally doesn't cover mental illnesses unless it's for a psychiatric consult and prescription meds. Cognitive behavior therapy is treated separately and most insurance only covers a small percentage for under 10 visits, if it covers that at all.

The travesty is that your brain is still attached to your body. They'd cover brain surgery, or procedures to embolize a potential stroke site. But the stuff inside the brain is still just as much of you as the stuff we can see. And it effects your health just as much as a brain tumor would.

As soon as we address how common this is, stop trying to throw meds at the problem as the only solution and add therapy to the mix, and then stop treating people with depression and other illnesses like aliens, we'd see fewer and fewer incidents like this.

l2xmbfs,"> The issue is that nearly a centaury later the great grand kids of the losers still live as non-citizens in conquered territory.

I feel the key here is whether Gaza is independent or actually conquered by Israel. They did leave Gaza, so I'm not sure they get to claim having been occupied by Israel.

Now, I feel the moral case of the West Bank population is FAR superior to the people in Gaza, because your description of what's been going on there is pretty accurate based on everything I've seen. Israel has literally allowed its own extremist population to simply outbreed its secular population, creating a nasty situation where the center-right has to ally with what amounts to a jewish ISIS to run the country. 

And I feel - as someone you might describe as center-right - that I'd much rather govern with the center-left than with the jewish ISIS.

> toss bombs into their prison, those unequal non-citizens become pissed off and develop an increasingly violent and suicidal culture.

Which is a reasonable bit of logic, and part of the problem. Once the mistakes were made, you can't exactly open that supermax and let them into society. You might have made them monsters, but that doesn't change the fact that now there are monsters in there in many ways.

The question of how to disentangle all of it is a tough one.

I don't see any way short of a demilitarized zone between Israel and Gaza, and someone with sufficient credibility and resources to keep Gaza from firing missiles at Israel.

That country probably needs to be a non-crazy Muslim one with resources. Indonesia and Turkey come to mind, with Saudi-Arabia and Egypt as second tier options. 

To pacify Gaza, they should propose a deal that allows them to also pacify the West Bank, up to and including getting the Israeli settlers out.

As a favor to Israel, all Hamas leaders who participated in planning the October 7th attack would be arrested and delivered to the Hague.

This would put Israel in a genuinely quite tough spot, because now everything (publicly say) they want is being offered to them. I'm sure Netanyahu would love nothing more than all Palestinians leaving both Gaza and the West Bank, but he can't exactly say that out loud himself without losing all support from the West short of maybe a third of Trump voters and a fifth of Dems, if that.

And those Muslim powers need to keep Iran away, because as long as it seems like Iran is collaborating with Russia (which is obvious), Europe will not work with Iran even a little bit as it is a clear enemy.",comment,Boston,0

I’m seeking help with getting an adult ADHD diagnosis as someone with no previous medication for it or paperwork diagnosing this.

I have Cigna insurance but it doesn’t cover an in depth assessment specifically for ADHD. I am confused as to if I can just book with a psychiatrist and they will be able to diagnose me or if I need to find another therapist stay with them for a while then have them refer me.? I looked at Roots Behavioral but saw another thread say they no longer do assessments and they refer you to get a diagnosis before they provide medication. I reached out to Clearwater and haven’t heard back. I am feeling confused and overwhelmed and was wondering if anyone could please help and explain going through the process.

cj2sfoe,"That sucks, for everyone involved and their families.

I came though that freeway just a few hours earlier that night. You just never know . . .

I was riding my motorcycle down the 118 a few years back after finishing an overnight shift. In the early morning light, I saw two headlights coming directly at me. After a split second of shock, I pulled to the far right (the lights were closer to the median) and let them pass.

I'd thought about honking or flashing or doing something to get their attention, but I was worried that they were possibly drunk or suicidal, or maybe just old and confused and might drive towards my flashing lights. So the safest thing to do was to get the hell out of the way.

I made it home safe, and went to bed. When I awoke later that day, the news had a report of a fatal head-on collision on the 118 . . .

1000 hospitalized, under 200 cases a day, in a state of almost 7,000,000. The curve is not only flattened, its bottomed.

If we are taking the scientific approach, which doomers love to parrot, we should be loosening restrictions to get those numbers up a bit. Waiting for a vaccine is economic suicide, a slow controlled burn where hospitals are not overwhelmed is ideal.

People ARE wearing masks in stores, people ARE distancing, people ARE keeping their only socializing outdoors. There is a middle ground that is not sit in your apartment for 6 weeks straight, and is not packed nightclubs.

hmummo2,"Homeless people would be best equipped to use UBI out of anyone. One of the heaviest weights of being homeless is the constant sensation (literally like carrying a weight, psychologically speaking) that you are a) right on the edge (of death, sanity, etc) and b) that your ways up &amp; out are either incredibly difficult (like for someone privileged to be in professional work, the effective equivalent of getting your dream promotion or next job, like it's a much higher bar to climb towards when you're down there than it seems from above, with many needs and health concerns taken care of and taken for granted) or you just are so mentally oppressed (then bring in addictions, traumas, illnesses) that it's effectively a form of depression that prevents from motivatedly seeking those options. And if you've ever had serious depression—either in bouts or chronically—you know the executive dysfunction that comes with it is not imaginary nor a personal choice. 

If a homeless person suddenly had say $200 a week, in my opinion it would be the *vast majority* who would suddenly find hope and motivation. It's like freezing to death and not knowing when you'll be warm again or ever, vs suddenly having a blanket that will at least keep you warm at the coldest times. 

Of course there will be individuals who waste their income irresponsibly (although apart from illegal drugs, this would go into the economy) but for the minority (again, imo) I'm afraid they would just have special needs and may be the few that just don't make it, sadly.

But no it really makes sense to me that UBI *in particular* would do a serious job helping the homeless problem, since a huge part of being homeless is being literally hopeless.",comment,LosAngeles,1

j35iyu3,"Drug psychosis: Been there done that. 6 yrs clean.
3rd time posting this statement this week about various stuff in Portland. (Sigh)

Modern day, drugs, are bioweapons dropped in our cities. Time to treat the organizations that bring them in like terrorists. Here's my psychosis story (again) in case it helps.

Psychosis Stump Speech: 

What is psychosis like?
I was exactly like that person: (now 6 yrs sober)

I grew up with undiagnosed ADD and developed a sort of codependency, always feeling like I wasn’t a good person unless I was helping other people with their problems. 

Then for 30 years I took care of my wife and two children all while traveling around the northwest taking care of other companies problems.

Eventually my dad died and my mother got stage four cancer …all while we were taking care of my mother-in-law who had a stroke and was in a wheelchair.

I had been a medium drinker but eventually got in a car accident and got extremely hooked on opiates during the recovery… This led to the VERY common habit of “trading addictions” and eventually to my drug of choice… Stimulants.

Three years later, I had been through rehab three times …and relapsed hard after Trump was elected (addicts find excuses to relapse) ...and was quickly divorced, then soon after …lost my job.

Quickly heading toward “rock bottom” I started using heavily to ""mask pain"" and started experiencing drug psychosis.

—————-

it was horrible - it’s kinda like sleep walking - You’re totally awake and conscious, but your brain (in my case sleep deprived, and overstimulated) stops functioning properly causing you to:

 “respond to internal stimuli”. 

If you think about it, everybody hears voices and sees things… Just not while we’re awake. I.e. dreams.

The voices are almost always tormenting!!!… and typically come from shame filled internal thoughts….From the direction of the nearest “imagined” source (cars, people, building windows…etc.). 

It happened both when I was using and long after I stopped.

I remember hearing one “story/narrative” from my right ear pressed against one wall, while a completely different story with my left ear pressed against another wall. 

The voices would stop in certain places (neighborhood stores where I felt safe) , then start up in others (usually when I felt alone or being watched by strangers)

My voices were all triggered by paranoia of people watching me or listening to me. Eventually, I believed somebody had put Communication devices in my head and home…. to purposely torment me for various reasons all having to do with “past and present low self-esteem”. I’d spend 2/3 of my day searching for the source of these voices and maybe 1/3 of it realizing I was delusional. It would come and go, which I eventually believed was part of a torture “schedule”.
It was highly confusing and I’m lucky to have survived it. 

Toward the end of my 5-7 months of psychosis:
1. The delusional period became fewer and far between.
2. I started developing tricks to fight it.
3. I remember realizing that I could force the voices to sing nursery rhymes or say other funny sentences which worked great for grounding but….

Funny side note: being able to “control voices” was really empowering… But came with a caveat.
I remember sitting in my house laughing out loud to myself because I was suddenly able to make these horrible characters in my head sing nursery rhymes or say dumb things…BUT this eventually lead to the belief that I had some sort of ESP or mind control over characters that I intermittently believed were real. At one point I remember wandering around OSHU looking for help, all while communicating with other people across the country, who also had ESP.

Not Good!!! But a common occurrence with this condition that can get dangerous for the inflicted.

But!!!! Luckily, I was able to reason myself out of that delusion with some common sense logic tricks.

TIP: this should only be done by professionals but, If you ever want to convince a schizophrenic that his voices are not real… Tell him/her to ask the voices To divulge something that only the “voice” knows (But the schizophrenic does not yet know):

1. Latest News headlines
2. stock market details
3. Weekly Weather forecast…etc.

I.e. something that the Schizophrenic cannot possibly  know until they check.

Why: this will force the delusional person to realize all claims and facts, are only coming from their own mind! The voices will never tell you anything that you didn’t already know or feel.

This works great for grounding, until your voices decide “not to cooperate with this little game.” Lol

Regarding assistance,
I called the police to my house, or car parking lots (dozens of times) reporting people following me, harassing me in the attic, basement or roof. Note: They generally will not arrest people that called them for help, as long as you are not a harm to yourself or other people. Police were almost always were kind and helped me become “grounded”. (A technique you learn in mental health and rehab where are you can snap out of your delusion usually from “positive triggers” or simply talking to nice people…etc.)

I did have a few younger cops (scared) lose their temper’s with me, and try to “bully me” into admitting I was suicidal so they could arrest me, but luckily I was older and just tolerated them peacefully. And that situation an ambulance showed in the Walmart parking lot where I called them from. They quickly assessed me and sent me home.

My point?
Always good to be careful but ignorance and stigma is THE REASON why society hasn’t effectively dealt with Mental health and or addiction yet…",comment,Portland,1

ii5oqaj,"Climate change as a whole is depressing, but seeing the snow melt off Hood in the summer isn't depressing because it's part of a natural cycle that happens every summer. Timberline Lodge got 600 inches of snow this season compared to its average of 450 inches, plus this season had a cooler and wetter spring than normal so the snowpack is melting out a couple of weeks behind normal. That means that this summer's melt is happening later than typical summers. In fact, there's still enough snow now that there is hardly any glacial ice exposed in this picture which is in sharp contrast to last summer. The normal melting process is healthy, there are lots of plants and animals that have adapted to live at higher elevations that are strutting their stuff during this short summer window before it snows again. In as short as six weeks there could be snow falling on the upper mountain and sticking on north facing slopes. 

In short, don't let this depress you. If every season was like this one the glaciers would melt out much slower than they have been. It's OK to enjoy the brief window where the upper slopes of Hood are melted out.",comment,Portland,1

Someone who is sad is not going to fake being happy and cheerful just because that’s what you’ve experienced in other areas where the general population isn’t so down on themselves. Seeing someone who isn’t sad like they are probably makes them feel insecure so you might get a “what are you so happy about?” attitude. I feel like the self centered energy of the city drains everyone. People are so out for themselves here and don’t want to see others do well from what I’ve experienced so it can definitely make you jaded to all the shitty attitudes you encounter in the city. You might be taking it more personally than you should, what I would suggest is when you don’t get the warm reaction you were hoping for don’t think what did I do wrong there? It’s more likely that the person you said hi to or have a nice day that didn’t reply has their own personal issues going on and has nothing to do with you. The other thing I could say is some people don’t see those gestures as having basic manners they think of going out of your way to exchange common niceties is just being fake. Those are just my takes obviously. I definitely experience more hospitality outside of the city. Here in Seattle I take it like people are just too busy to be bothered. If it’s someone working a customer service job and they don’t even say you’re welcome it might be their passive aggressive way of showing they don’t give a fuck about their job or the customers, I feel like there’s plenty of that in the city especially with people who work customer facing jobs haha.

A possession I just took down from the wall is a picture my father took of that billboard that read ""will the last person leaving Seattle turn out the lights.""

We had our chance to get ahead of this movement and do the right thing by people who were already here and people who are moving here. We messed up and didn't. Now we are paying the price of severe growing pains.

Capitol Hill and Ballard and the Central Area shouldn't have been the only places where we put denser-style living. We shouldn't have only approved box-like townhouses and big apartment buildings. People should have agreed with my parents and voted for Forward Thrust. None of those happened, and here we are.

I struggled financially when I first got here making it difficult for me to go out into this city I moved to and experience what it has to offer.  Right about the time I start feeling financially stable COVID hits and everything shuts down.

A couple months later BLM protests kick off.  I support the movement and believe infighting for justice, ending systemic and systematic racism, and creating much stronger accountability for law enforcement.  I attended some protests early on and started using my Facebook as a platform to speak on how I felt about current events.

Now my mother has expressed her disappointment with me for expressing these views.  She feels I should ""fact check"" more even though I provide sources for most of my posts and tells me I need to ""research blacl on black crime"".  I've always had a close relationship with my mother and we've never disagreed on much of anything and then I get hit with this.  I don't know how to respond to her.

fsz8dil,"The three times I needed cops;

1. A woman with dementia came up to me and handed me money and started speaking to me as if I were her son. I walked up to the precinct that was near by, told a cop that around the corner was a woman who needed medical help. He said “that’s not my problem” and walked away.

2. I had a bipolar roommate who had a severe delusional episode and so we called emergency services and a cop showed up and asked what was happening and we explained he was having a bipolar episode to be and he said ""bipolar, what's that?"" And I explained to him that it's a mental disorder where your brain switches between depressive and manic states, and right now he was having a manic episode and the cop rolled his eyes, told the radio ""he has a problem with his friend being too happy"" and then drove away. My friend went another 7 hours without treatment.

3. My apartment got robbed and the detectives came, asked questions, left and accidentally left the finger print kit behind on the kitchen table and I never saw them again for the rest of my life.

This is not counting all the times I called and they never showed up. Or I’ve seen them harassing people on the subway. Or my friends were raped and literally were laughed at at the police station by the detective. The cops are worthless. That 3 billion budget is nothing but bloat, it’s being wasted",comment,NYC,1

1b8qmee,"Would you live in LA or NYC in my situation? I (28M) work in tech and have the opportunity to work remote. I'm trying to decide between NYC and LA (specifically Manhattan vs. Santa Monica) and it's a surprisingly hard decision.

I'm recently single and I'm prioritizing making friends, focusing on my career, and finding romance. However, I spent the past few years in San Diego and I absolutely loved the weather there but not the people- it was just a bit too laid back and difficult to find young professionals there. I was hoping that LA and specifically the West Side next to the ocean would mimic the San Diego life and give me access to the social scene I wanted. I initially completely discounted NYC because it was so much more expensive and I hate the weather in the Northeast since I'm from that region. 

However, when I crunch the numbers after factoring in my car payment and insurance, I realize it's actually kinda close price-wise. Then I think about how sprawling LA is compared to NYC and how difficult it could be to make friends. And then I think about how NYC has a much better tech scene than LA and would help my career almost as much as SF. Finally I'm pretty sure dating works out a lot in my favor in NYC as well...

But then I remember being depressed after working a long day and standing on my balcony breathing in the ocean air. Or walking out in gym shorts late at night in the middle of winter. And always waking up to golden sunshine. My job is crazy stressful and I would have gone insane working from home in San Diego without the sun.

jfw6ecm,"I’m not from Seattle, but I need to post here because it feels like the only place I can talk about this. I didn’t know Ashley but this news hit me hard. Frankly, it was really triggering and the note felt like a punch in the stomach. My first reaction was to be angry. Not angry at her, but angry that depression is a such a cruel and disgusting disease that it could cause her to do and post something like this thinking that nobody would care, or that we could just find out and then carry on with our lives. I didn’t know her but it seems like she had a tough life and it really doesn’t feel fair at all. 

A weird thing about parasocial relationships is that there’s this illusion that you know everything about someone just because you can read their posts. And then when something absolutely shocking like this happens, you scramble for an explanation but the only thing you can do is use the only avenue at your disposal (i.e. the internet) to try to make sense of it. I found myself looking at her and her mothers post over and over again, but eventually I realized I didn’t even know what I was looking for , and I was just trapping myself in this loop of checking and then re-triggering myself and then checking again. 

Obviously there is no explanation that can make this ok. It is an awful thing that happened. My brain keeps trying to find a shortcut that can take away the pain, but the tough reality is that there isn’t one. 

All we can do now is do our best to be forces of good in the world. Everyone always says stuff like that after tragedies, but it really is true.  

I find myself also taking extra time lately to feel small things, like sensation of  a breeze on my face. That helps.  (Bonus anxiety pro tip: holding an ice pack is also super calming. That’s another one of my go-tos)

I'd estimate 80% of my friends who went to USC and were quite humble people turned into wannabe Kardashians (and the male equivalents). 

One of my friends was complaining about Joe Biden and the rising cost of everything like how leggings cost $150 now. I sent her a link to old navy leggings and she was so disgusted.

Figuring out dosage turned out to be hell because, without the right dose, I struggled to manage my T1 diabetes and the rollercoaster blood sugars triggered severe depression. It took me nine months to recover from the resulting spiral.

I’m more stable now, but I’m realizing the side effects of the new meds are absolutely insidious and, practically speaking, they eliminate any benefit I get from taking the pills.

I reached out to my doctor, but now she won’t let me switch back to the original meds. Instead, she is pushing me to change my carefully titrated dose again or try other meds in the same family.

In the depression, the Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon decided to 'cut out the rot' from the economy which had been in a sort of bubble in the 1920s by raising interest rates, which caused companies on the edge of profitability to fail.

I didn't receive the recertification paperwork but that doesn't seem relevant. I was in the hospital 21 days over the summer for being suicidal, this is really bad timing to lose my health insurance. Should I just go to the hospital? I qualify for medicaid, will I get emergency medicaid or will I be stuck with bills? No one seems to want to go with me to the medicaid office and I can't seem to get myself there on my own without a breakdown.

There was also another, longer tunnel, which was supposed to connect Los Feliz to the old zoo, and another tunnel (a continuation of the same railway) to the area that would eventually become Travel Town. The line would eventually hit Burbank.

Tunneling started some time in the late 1910s at the old zoo, but a lot of the old passenger railways were unprofitable and were converted to bus lines in the 1920s, so the project was abandoned. Commuters could just take a bus paralleled the river instead. Nobody seems to know how long the tunnel actually is.

If you do nothing about the problem, people will try again and eventually succeed. You're pointing out that there is more depression in Japan...duh, that's the point. The suicide issue isn't a gun issue and you can only solve it if you focus on lowering the number of attempts, not the method of attempt. Removing guns doesn't fix the suicide problem. Suggesting that I don't care about suicide deaths is not constructive. I'm not arguing the numbers of total deaths, I'm just saying it disingenuous to portray suicides and homicides as they are the same thing. If you're talking about gun violence, referencing suicides is only obfuscating the information that could help you understand the problem of homicides. And referencing homicides is completely irrelevant to suicides. I would like to be practical and find actual solutions to these problems, which starts with understanding them. Rhetoric will get you nowhere. Blindly focusing on cherry-picked facts gets you nowhere. Saying more guns equals more death over and over doesn't make it any more true.

In the majority of cases they are not and they are caused by environmental triggers.

And if they were chronic and permanent, that in no way would imply they cannot be treated. Modern medicine treats chronic diseases all the time, very successfully so.

Depressions meanwhile, whether of the acute major depressive disorder or chronic dysthymia (which is a mild depression anyway), have very good medical prognoses when treated properly.

dudpujf,"I think gun violence in the US has to do with anger--anger that life isn't going the way he (and its always been a he) thinks it should, the pressure to achieve/gendered expectations and anger when those expectations cannot be met and/or that pressure is too strong, and a massive lack of empathy for others.

I think fixing that is going to require a massive change. Better mental health services will help, but the people who do these things aren't ""crazy""--they're rational. They may be depressed or anxious, but they are absolutely in control and plan out these events.

Another thing we could do is work on changing gender expectations on men. Women have made huge strides in breaking out of our gender norms, but men still seemed to be locked into the role of Provider and Macho Man. I think men need a movement centered on healthy gender norms and role models. It makes sense to me that some men look at what's happening in the world (shrinking middle class, massive income inequality, government in the pocket of corporations, climate change) and externalize their rage. 

Feminists also have a place here. We need to do a much better job of holding ourselves and each other accountable for how we view and treat men. 

Ultimately, I think we need to have a real, honest reckoning with how hopeless the future looks to many people. That includes the 24-hour news, as you said, but it also includes things like the everyday violence of capitalism and the lack of ANY governmental accountability at practically all levels and how climate change will continue to impact the world. I think some men look at the world, see that they will never be able to be a provider or get the girl and they get angry--and, without hope that anything will change, they lash out. 

I do disagree with you that there aren't governmental solutions. I think we need both governmental solutions and social solutions. A men's movement would be a social solution, but instituting real healthcare, doing something about income inequality and climate change--those are going to require governmental solutions to curb the excesses of lassaiz faire capitalism.

&gt;Being trapped in with family with too much screen time  
&gt;  
&gt;And coupled with being stuck at home without any real social outlets this can have serious affects. Especially if there isn’t any parental involvement. 

Personally, I don't think social media the way it's constructed is doing youth many social favors, I agree with you there. But it's a ignorant to think that being ""stuck"" with family (as if that's some kind of broad issue) and an assumed increase in social media use is the answer to all this. It's much more complex than that. Shit even the King5 article of this post explains that it's a result of an overwhelmed health care system. It's a result of the state's reluctance to adequately fund mental health counseling. It's a result of mental health not being socially understood or approached in a consistent way. Do I think that social media and a loss of outlets play a part? No question, they absolutely do, but they are not the sole causes. They just so happen to be stressing an already overflowing system.

As to social media's connection with suicide, it's actually [inconclusive whether it's a cause of suicide in any direct way](https://blog.pcc.com/social-media-self-esteem-and-teen-suicide). In fact, it's more helpful than it is harmful for the most part. From the article:

&gt;How could \[social media\] be a positive thing? Simply put: context. Other factors in suicide or attempted suicide could be related to abuse or neglect, untreated mental illness, fears over expectations, fears about their future, or a lack of healthy outlets for a child’s physical or emotional needs, which includes their blossoming identities as a young adult. When a child’s family, support network, and healthcare team work together to recognize the warning signs of depression, suicidal ideations, self harm, and possible suicide attempts, contextual evidence from the patient’s history and life can help physicians and families to understand the causes of suicide and prevent it from happening.

So then for you to take the resources you shared and extrapolate this:

&gt; Being trapped in with family with too much screen time

as being the sole factor seems to ignore the many factors at hand and devolve it to the internet and increased family time (which you haven't explained has to do with your statements?).",comment,Seattle,0
hd8agia,"“Black youth are approximately 14% of the total youth population, but 47.3% of the youth who are transferred to adult court by juvenile court judges “who believe the youth cannot benefit from the services of their court,” write the report’s authors.

For instance, black youth are 53.1% of youth transferred for person offenses despite the fact that black and white youth made up an equal percentage of youth charged with person offenses, 40.1% and 40.5% respectively, in 2015.

The new report points to decades of research showing that children sent to adult jails and prisons are more likely to die by suicide, suffer from mental illness, and more likely to be abused when in side. These same kids, once they are released back into their communities, are far more likely to recidivate than kids convicted of the same or similar crimes, but who are kept in the juvenile justice system.”

c9oape3,"There are no tricks here: study after study shows that where there are more guns (red states) there is more gun homicide and suicide (red states), the Harvard research I linked to is part of that body of work. 

There is no credible science that disputes the fact that more guns mean more gun crime. The NRA funded some frauds and pseudoscientists in the 90s (Lott, Kleck, Kates, et al) but they have long been debunked.

It's absolutely fair to assign the blame to Chuck's Gun Shop. For example, Chuck's Gun Shop does not sit in the middle of London, but if it did (and London had our lax gun control laws) then rest assured London would have a gun murder problem above and beyond what it would have without it (especially considering the current ultra low gun murder rate in Britain).

Chicago can't regulate gun stores outside of its boundaries that flood its streets with cheap guns. People go to Indiana and Mississippi and buy guns in bulk there and sell them from their trunks in Chicago.  So Chuck's Gun Shop is an excellent example of the need for strong federal controls. 

People like me who advocate for background checks and limits on things like assault rifles don't care about the number of people stabbed to death each year. We are arguing about gun control, not knife control.  So in other words, the ""overall violence"" NRA talking point is really just a paper thin distraction from the real issues at hand. 

If you want to look where that talking point failed, look at Australia after their sweeping gun reform in 1996, it has been a remarkable success. 

This data only accounts for homicide totals for the first quarter of 2013. Unfortunately, it is so fresh that it hasn't been segregated into gun crime or even the number of shootings. It is not meant as a replacement for the science I have provided, but is just a starting point for a discussion. We already know that more guns mean more gun homicide. ",comment,Chicago,0
d3rq4ek,"My grandfather moved out here during the great depression. After working for a bit, he bought some land in the boondocks of Seattle. Over the decades, he built a house and some outbuildings. He died in the early 80s, his wife not long after, leaving it to their daughter, my mother, who was single in her early 20s. You are correct, no mortgage. He hated banks.

She struggled for years to maintain the property, but a single working class income makes this difficult to do. Property taxes rolled around each year like the plague. There is no assistance for this situation. Tax assessors told her to sell, with no other option and often cruelly. Eventually, she did. 

She lives alright in the boondocks, but the government forced us out of our family home.

igztkia,"Same, only I'm 31f, with a shitty apartment in a bad neighborhood I'm sharing with 2 strangers, one of which regularly pees on the floor, leaves pubes around the toilet, fingernails in the sink, and hair clogging the drain. One time he got high and literally left a turd sitting on the toilet seat. The other leaves her used pads completely open, sitting upwards, on top of each other in a mountain in the trash. I work at a shitty job in Long Island that I drive 90 mins each way to, at a lonely complex completely isolated from society, and makes me feel depressive daily.

I have a few not-for-real friends I've met from my first job here, and we see each other once every other month or so. Not a real actual friendship with a real connection or anything in common.

I've tried the dating app scene since I got here and it's been a living nightmare. The guys I've met either jump from girl to girl all week long, flake, or live with their mom at 30+ without any real motivation to do much more than that. Or they just wanna pump n dump, despite selecting ""looking for a relationship"" on their profiles. 2 weeks ago I met up with a guy who asked me out to dinner, then to a popular rooftop afterwards. At the last minute, he changes his mind without me knowing and we end up walking to his apartment complex (""because it has an even better rooftop""). I hopped in an Uber home, he got pissed, slammed the car door, and ghosted me. Same thing one week later, only just ghosted after saying no to first-date sex (he also said he was looking for a relationship). So I tried the other way, where I talk for at least a week first to get a feel on the guy's intentions... and no one has time or interest in that. Lol. I tried the Staten/Long Island guys as a last resort but they mostly lived with their moms or were just generally incompatible with my lifestyle (extremely conservative; hated the City; nights out meant Texas Roadhouse...although I'm never too good for the rolls).

3zr4um,"Dear hiring managers, local business owners and lawyers... I am in my 40's. I never smoked weed until I was 35, and I chose to do so only as an alternative treatment to PTSD.

I had a successful career working at Verizon Wireless in their call center for many MANY years, until they moved my job to Utah.

Here is my question. When I am at work, I rarely have ever had an issue with PTSD (it's mostly when I'm alone, or alone walking in public that I have issues) I've NEVER smoked at work and I wasn't smoking when I applied to Verizon so it's never been an issue. 

Now I've been unemployed for over a year. I've sent out 75+ resumes and only received two interviews. The first one, I did not lie at all. In the interview I told them I would never be at work drunk or high. My interviewer laughed with me at the thought. They pretty much offered me a job but still asked me to do a drug test. I had no problem with that because I understand they may need to check for harder drugs. That being said, I didn't get the job.. and I'm pretty sure it was the pee testing positive for THC. 

I hadn't even applied to most places that I felt qualified for because I know they will drug test, and I don't want to lie or fake it. 

I am finding it very hard to even apply to a position when so many state ""NO DRUGS - EVEN WEED"" 

So here's my question to you: Why do you test for pot, and how is that even legal? If our ~~city~~ state has said, as an adult I can smoke weed responsibly - why can I be denied a job for a positive test in a pre-screen? I really do not understand the logic here. Our ~~city~~ state has stated that pot is as recreational as alcohol. 

I can not seem to find a job AND treat my PTSD without resorting to pills (that also have a side effect of increased suicide if I were to stop taking them) so I have given up weed. It's only been 4 days or so.

I don't feel depressed or sad, but I do feel my mind racing and I have to fight the panic attacks without the help of marijuana. I'm sure I will be *able* to not smoke for 30 days, and then as long as it takes to find a position.  But why do we have to play this game? 

I was afraid to get a medical card and end up on a 'list' - but that fear is subsiding.  If I had a medical card would that even make a difference to you as a job provider?

Thank you for your time, and suggestions.

Back to the video I linked, the only reason that man was allowed to speak the truth he did was because his entire family was killed off during the Holocaust, which is the trump card of marginalization, so by their own rules, he had to be heard.

Recently the case of a WOC claiming she was being bullied because a white woman quoted MLK and his call for peaceful protesting (instead of agreeing with a tweet the WOC wrote) turned into ruining the white womans career, hurdling her into a depression and years of online bullying. Only for the texts to come out later that proved the white woman was actually being bullied by the black woman (and the white woman did a ton of charity work that helped marginalized communities).

Second, if you can financially afford it, re-assure him that everything is fine, and he'll find something soon enough. Don't over sugar-coat it - again it's kinda patronizing. But let him know you support him.

Lastly, don't feed him a bunch of jobs - just sites he can find jobs. If he's depressed, he probably wants to feel accomplished by finding something himself.

fpgm7if,"I'm I guess what you'd call a moderate in this debate. 

I think your story shows that we can't eliminate this by staying home. It would take literally everyone staying home and literally never leaving for a month to get even close to eradication. Obviously, that's not possible.

The whole point of the lockdowns and social distancing is to keep from overwhelming the health care system. This seems to be a misconception. A lot of folks are under the impression that the lockdowns were intended to rid the country of the virus. 

We have to live with the fact that some people are going to get sick and yes, some will die. We obviously want to minimize that, but there has to be a balance between destroying the economy letting people needlessly die.

We've already seen that over 20% of the working population is now unemployed. What happens when your health insurance is employer provided and you get laid off? Now you don't have health insurance or income to pay for your own. Now any small sickness, injury, etc. becomes a much bigger deal than it used to be. More people will die because they can't or won't pay for health care out of pocket. 

Depression and suicide sky rocketed after the great depression and the major recessions. If we hit 30 or 40% unemployment, more than it ever was during those times, how many people will commit suicide? How many people will never recover from the depression of becoming destitute?

No government can support paying for 20% of its working population to not work for very long. So while the economic impacts don't seems so huge now, what happens when the $350 billion financial aid bills stop? How long can the government keep sending $1200 checks to people when there's no tax revenue because nobody can work so the feds collect no payroll tax, no income tax, etc?

The reality is that nothing will eliminate the virus except a vaccine. At BEST that's 8 months away. More likely a year or more. The gov't can't support a locked down population that long. So at some point, we have to start carefully reopening the economy. Is it too early? Nobody knows for sure, but obviously you'll find staunch supporters of both sides of that argument.

Personally, I think as others have mentioned, being open doesn't mean people will return to normal. There's a bias especially on Reddit because frankly, you only see the people who are carelessly going about life like it never changed. The vast majority of people are still isolating and being cautious, you just don't see them because, well, they're at home. Myself included. 

I'm not going to any restaurants or bars any time soon, but I can see why we need to start slowly reopening some businesses.

To be really blunt in answering your question, even if the upper side of the projections comes true and 200,000 people in the US die from this virus, the economy won't notice. That's 4,000 people per state.

If 4,000 people in every state straight up disappeared tomorrow, the economy as a whole wouldn't notice. We're talking 200,000 deaths over the course of a year. 

Even if a million people get sick with the virus and are temporarily not working while recovering, that's not happening all at once and it's a small blip for the economy. 

But 30+ million people in 6 weeks leaving the workforce indefinitely? That is a massive hit on the economy.",comment,Austin,1

dmlry3a,"The city required a nag screen saying ""you need to wear a helmet"" in the app.

I'd be interested in what happened to helmet use stat collection when you end up with ""Bicyclist Deaths by Helmet Use"" data as in the table appearing here - http://www.helmets.org/stats.htm

For decades the ""not known"" helmet status was well under 10% and then from 2010 to 2014 it shot up to nearly 1/4 of all bicyclist deaths have no recording as to if helmeted or not.

It's hard to know the effect of helmets when you don't record the status of a helmet in a large portion of the fatalities.  It can obscure what's subject to external forces, like when people roll gun-suicide deaths in with all gun fatalities.

Of course, the Seattle Bike Blog sometimes omits helmet involvement too as his [followup stories about tragic deaths with only one known vehicle](https://www.seattlebikeblog.com/2016/09/21/man-dies-after-mysterious-crash-in-ne-seattle-rip-rc-rogers/) never included the plea from family.

Ultra rich means folks earning over a hundred million a year, who often dodge tons of tax responsibility and can lobby Congress to get heaps of financial aid.

h5ew9ka,"&gt;  Non-police go into these situations with the mindset ""I have no lethal means of defense available and any physical force I use puts my job at risk and opens me personally up to malpractice suits and loss of licensure"". 

It would be a complete failure of the program if they had to use any type of physical force to coerce someone into complying.  It wouldn't be just about malpractice or licensure.  

&gt;That's a very different mindset from ""if I must, I can defend myself with deadly force and count on the protections of my union and qualified immunity"". 

Who has that mindset?  I mean, I'm not going to beat around the bush here, the fact that you are trying to portray Police officer beliefs like this is fucking bullshit.  It's a complete lie fabricated by the people who run around screaming ACAB.  

The idea that police believe they can do whatever they want without repercussions is a complete lie and trying to presume that's the truth loses any argument that you are trying to make.  I'm going to try to continue but this was the point I was getting to with your previous comments about police and your ""clarification"" only made your stance worse.  

&gt;I am working on the assumption that if those 150 calls regularly resulted in excessive use of police and/or high risk to citizens, the actual police chief of the area would not be in favor of it.

I'm working under the assumption that we don't know the details of those cases and given that the entire premise of the program is addressing an extremely limited number of incidents, the idea that we can dismiss 150 calls is not acceptable as an answer.  

&gt;Do you have any evidence that the police chiefs from 1989 - present are working against the best interest of the police &amp; community?

It's not necessary for my argument to hold up.  Perception can be very different from reality which is why I'm focusing on the data not public statements from officials who will always try to portray situations as positive.

&gt;As for sources -

You aren't paying attention.  If you can't bother to actually look at the whole picture and instead just focus on the things that fit your narrative, you will FAIL in trying to convey your arguments to anyone who doesn't already blindly agree with you.  Start paying attention to the counterarguments rather than just patting yourself on the back for finding sources that agree with you.

For example, the entire point that I made in my previous post that you just completely ignored was that federal funding has been increasing year over year and significantly.  Your response to this is to point at STATE funding for mental health.  Why do you think this is important?  Why do you think I pointed it out?  Why do you think I brought it up?

Mental health spending has been transitioning to medicaid.  State budgets for mental health care are reducing and being replaced with medicaid/medicare spending where the states get VASTLY more funding.

[Here is a graph that points it out](https://imgur.com/SGxshhS) and [then the corresponding source for the data.](https://store.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/d7/priv/sma14-4883.pdf)

Nearly all of your sources are media articles.  The only source that I would even put in value in is the NAMI study but even it is solely focusing on STATE spending.  When you check the actual source data for their study, they clarify saying that medicaid/care spending is not generally included in their data.  

Private insurance and out of pocket has remained largely stable for the past 20 years in the percentage of spend.  State funding in general has been reduced while federal funding has increased.  Overall, the public funds have increased in their percentage of coverage of the spend.

You keep referencing how Illinois shut down 50% of publicly funded mental health facilities.  Do you even know how many mental health facilities are in Illinois?  As of 2018, [364.](https://imgur.com/dPkI2k4) [ Illinois also has more psychiatric hospitals than most other states.](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/cbhsq-reports/NMHSS-2018.pdf)  The qualification that you need to actually pay attention to in the MEDIA ARTICLES you keep referencing is ""PUBLICLY FUNDED"".  Just like with most other states, there are more PRIVATELY funded psychiatric health hospitals than there are public.  This is why federal funding becomes incredibly important in these discussions because private facilities accept medicare/medicaid and it won't show up on the STATES numbers.  It only shows up in conjunction with state funded facilities.

&gt;I am also working from the presumption that most police officers find gravely injuring or ending the life of another person to be a stressful and traumatic event, even when that shooting is completely justifiable. Reducing them benefits everyone, police included.

Pay attention the numbers.  Actually start listening when the numbers point out the actual prevalence of these incidents.  Out of more than TEN MILLION ARRESTS... TEN MILLION... ~1,000 ended up in police involved shootings.  

To put it bluntly, WHAT ARE YOU REDUCING?  You are taking a completely trivial number and then going out of your way to try to reduce it.  This is where you are failing to justify your stance.  

&gt; That's still 20 officers who don't have to deal with the mental health ramifications, personal life ramifications, or professional stress that shooting someone can cause.

Ok, I want you to understand here.  The current design of the movement is to impart massive, nationwide change and here you are saying that the benefit would be to impact 20 police officers (or basically 20 police involved shootings).  This is not a justification.  You are not justified in your position here.  I want yo to look at these numbers rationally and say that you actually believe these are justified because there is ZERO ways you can represent these numbers to be justified.  You are making judgment calls that are ENTIRELY emotional and our entire process of government is designed to REMOVE emotional legislation from being passed.  

&gt;If we have 30 years of evidence that programs like CAHOOTS don't cause madmen with guns to be running around and don't create more expenses then they save wouldn't it be worth it just for that?

What are the outcomes of the 150 calls that CAHOOTS failed on?  If you want to say that the evidence you are presenting supports you, then we're literally talking about 150 calls because that's the reality of just how little incidents are happening that even that few of calls would actually impact the success or failure of the program.  Again, I'm looking at the data itself.  

&gt;By that logic, if even 1 of those officer involved shootings happened because the police lacked the capabilities needed to understand why a non-verbal autistic man holding a toy truck wasn't complying with their orders doesn't it mean the policing program has failed?

The baseline is the current number of police involved shootings.  If the baseline for police involved shootings is 1000 over the course of 10 MILLION+ arrests.  Then even having ONE situation where a social worker resulted in deaths would put it at a HIGHER PERCENT than the baseline.  Again, the data is all the matters here.  If you want to talk about an autistic kid holding a toy truck, then you are trying to argue emotional and emotional arguments without data to back them up are worthless.  If you can't get past the emotional arguments, then you really need to rethink your position.  Emotion can't be your sole reason for an argument.  You need the data to support it and you need to account for ALL of the data, not just the data that fits your narrative.

So, just to sum it up, you focuses solely on state spending while ignoring federal spending.  You made bigoted comments about police officers where you might as well tattoo ACAB on your forehead.  You continue to ignore the data and presume that 20 incidents out of 10 MILLION chances is enough to warrant a complete nationwide change.  

I'm afraid for the future right now with regard to our legal systems because of people like you.  What you are representing is emotion over facts.  It's mob mentality.  It's like demanding active shooter drills be taught at every school in the country because of 3 incidents.  It's completely irrational and strictly emotional.  It's demanding that assault rifles be banned despite the fact that most gun related deaths are done with hand guns and are suicides.  This is a complete regression away from legal authority, justice and due process.
